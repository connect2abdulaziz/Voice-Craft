the acid column generates more than enough income to cover expenses with the balance
reinvested into the Asset account continues to grow and therefore the incomplete produces grows with it
the result is that the rich get richer why the middle class struggle the middle class finds itself in a constant
play the financial struggle their primary income is through their salary as their wages increase so to their taxes their expenses 10
hence the phrase the rat race the Twitter home is the primary acid instead of invest
income producing assets this pattern of treating your home as an investment and the philosophy that the parents means you can buy a larger home or spend more
is the foundation of today's written society increased spending throws families in the greater debt and in the more financial uncertainty
and receiving raises on a regular basis this is high risk living caused by weak financial education
the mass of loss of jobs in recent times prove that shaky the middle class really is financially company pension plans are being
placed by 41k plants social security is obviously in trouble and can't be relied upon as a source for retirement
yesterday for the middle class today Mutual Funds are popular because they supposedly represent safety average Mutual Fund
safe for the children's college and pay of credit cards they do not have time to study investing
so they will lie on the expertise of the manager of a mutual fund also because the mutual fund includes many different types of Investments
this educated middle class subscribers to the dogma put up by mutual fund brokers and financial planners
play it safe avoid risk the real tragedy is that the lack of early financial education is what creates the risk faced by
the reason I have to play safe is because the financial positions are tenuous at best their balance sheets are not
instead there are loaded with liabilities and have no real assets to generate income typically they are only source of income is
paycheck their livelihood becomes entirely dependent on their employer so when genuine deals of a lifetime come along these
can take advantage of them because they are working so hard or text to the max and are loaded with that as I said at the start of this section
the most important role is to know the difference between an asset and the liability what you understand the difference concentrate your efforts on
my income generating assets that's the best way to get started on a path to becoming rich keep doing that in your asset column will
keep liabilities and expenses down so more money is available to continue foreign into the Asset column soon the acid base
so deep that you can afford to look at more speculative investments investments that may have returns of 100% to infinity
turn into 1 million dollars or more investments that the middle class cause to risky the investment
as an employee who is also a home owner you are working efforts are generally as follows
employees make their business owner or the shareholders rich not themselves your efforts and success
provide for the owners success and retirement to you work for the government the government takes IT share from your pay check before
differentiate by working harder you simply increase the amount of tax is taken by the government most people work from January to May
for the government 3 you work for the bank after taxes your next largest expense is usually your mortgage and
the problem with simply working harder is that each of these three levels takes a greater share of your increase efforts
how to learn how to have your increased efforts benefit you and your family directly once you have decided to concentrate on my in your own business
focusing your efforts on acquiring assets instead of a bigger pay check how do you set your goals most people must keep the job and rely on
to find the acquisition of assets as their assets grow how did they measure the extent of their success when does someone know that
which that they have wealth as well as having my own definitions for Assets and liabilities I also have my own definition for wealth
and others call him genius years ago he got
text buzzing because he applied for paint for something he called the geodesic Dome but in the application for also said something about well
it was pretty confusing at first but after reading it began to make some sense wealth is a person's ability to survive so many number
if I stopped working today how long could I survive unlike network the difference between
Sachin liabilities which is often filled with a person's expense of junk and opinions of what things are worth this definition creates the possibility for developing
truly accurate measurement I could now measure and know where I was in terms of my goal to become financially independent
net worth of an includes non cash producing assets like stuff you bought the noise in your garage wealth measures how much money you are money is making
and therefore you are financial survivability wealth is the measure of the cash flow from the Asset column compared with the expense colum
let's use an example let's say I have cash flow from my asset column of $1000 a month and I have monthly expenses
$2000 months what is my wealth let's go back to back Mr Falls definition using his definition how many
can I survive a woman of 30 day month I have enough cash flow for have a month when I achieve
cash flow from my assets then I will be worthy so while I am not yet rich I am wealthy I now have income
cover my monthly expenses if I want to increase my expenses I first must increase my cash
how to maintain this level of wealth also note that it is at this point that I'm no longer dependent on my wages I have focused on
successful in building an asset account that is made me financially independent if I quit my job today I would be able to cover my monthly expen
who is the cash flow from my assets my next goal would be to have the excess cash flow from my assets reinvested into the
the more money that goes into my asset column the more my asset column grows the more my assets grow the more my cash
and as long as I keep my expenses less than the cash flow from these assets I grow witcher with more and more income from sources other than
as this reinvestment process continues I am well on my way to becoming rich just remember this simple observation
the rich by assets the poor only have expenses the middle class by liabilities they think are assets
so how do I start mind in my own business what is the answer listen to the founder of McDonald's in the next chapter
chapter 3 lesson 3 mind your own business
focus on your asset columns while everyone else focuses on their income statements in 1974 rate
founder of McDonald's was asked to speak to the MBA class at the University of Texas at Austin a friend of mine was a student in that MBA
after a powerful and inspiring talk the Classic joint and the students asked Ray if he would join them at their favourite Hangout to have a few bears
great graciously accepted what business environment
most of the MBA students just pulling around No one answer sorry asked again what business do you think
the students life again and finally one brave soldier out Ray who in the world doesn't know that you are in the hammer of business
that's what I thought you would say he passed and then quickly added ladies and gentlemen I am not in business
is my friend tells the story we spent a good amount of time explain in his view point in his business
renew that the primary business focus was the cell hammer the franchises for what he never lost side of was the location of the train
he knew that the land and its location with the most significant factors in the success of each franchise basically the person who
franchise was also buy in the real estate under the franchise for recreation today McDonald's is the largest single owner
state in the world on an even more than the Catholic Church McDonald's on some of the most valuable intersections and Street corners in America
and around the globe my friend consider this is one of the most important lessons in his life today he owns car washes
the previous chapter presented the most people work for everyone but themselves
for the owners of the company then for the government to taxes and finally for the bank that owned their mortgage
I am so young boy we did not have a McDonald's nearby Rich Dad was responsible for teaching mic and meet the same lesson that Ray crop
University of Texas it is secret number 3 of the rich The Secret is mind your own business
financial struggle is often directly the result of people work in all their lives for someone else many people will simply have nothing at the
our current educational system focuses on preparing today's news to get good jobs by develop
many will
Police officers artist writers and so on these professional
allow them to enter the workforce and work for money but there is a big difference between your profession and your business
I ask people what is your business and they will say I am a Banker when I asked them if they on the bank and they usually respond
no I worked there and that instance they have confused their profession with their business their profession may be a Banker
still need their own business a problem with school is that you often become what you study so if you study cooking you become a chef
if you study the law you become an attorney and the study of auto mechanics makes you a mechanic the mistake can be come in what you study
the too many people forget to mind their own business they spend their lives mind in someone else's business and making that person rich
become financially secure a person is to mind their own business your business revolves around your asset column not your income column
the number one rule is to know the difference between an asset and a liability and to buy assets the rich
while everyone else focuses on their income statements that is why we hear so often I need a race
show me I had a promotion I am going back to school to get more training so I can get a better job I am going to work overtime maybe I
in some circles these are sensible ideas but you are still not minding your own business these ideas
focus on the income column and will only help a person become more financially secure if the additional money is used to purchase income generate in ass
the primary reason the majority of the poor and middle class are physically conservative which means I can't afford to take risks is that they have
furniture Foundation they have to clean to their jobs and play it safe became the intent to do Millions
their home was eating the my life was cost in the money every month
the golf clubs in the garage the cost $1000 anymore
without job security they had nothing to fall back on what they are assets could not help them survive in a time of financial crisis
are you soon most of us have filled out a Credit application to buy a house or car it's always interesting to look at the net worth
because of what accepted Bank in an accounting practices allow a person to count as assets one day when I wanted a loan my financial
too good so I added my new golf clubs by our collection books Electronics or morning suits wrist watches shoes
other personal effects to boost the number in the Asset column but I was turned down because I had too much investment real estate the loan committee
they wanted to know why I did not have a normal job with the salary they did not question your money suits
when you do not fit the standard profile I cringe every time I hear someone say to me
one of the main reasons net worth is not accurate is simply because
the moment you begin selling your assets your text for any games so many people have put themselves in deep financial Trouble When They Run short
assets but their personal assets can generally be sold for only a fraction of the value that is listed on the
if there is a game on the sale of the assets their text on the game so again the government takes IT share those
tell me about available to help them out of that that is why I say someone's net worth is often worth less than anything start mind
on business start buying real assets not liabilities are personal facts that have no real value once you get them
a new car loses nearly 25% of the price you pay for the moment you drive it afterward it is not a true asset even if your
my $400 new Titanium driver was worth Rs 150 the moment it of keep
tenses love reduce liabilities and diligently build the base of solid assets for young people who have not yet left home it is important
thanks to teach some the difference between an asset and liability get them to start building a solid acid column before they leave home
buy house have kids and get stuck in a risky financial position cleaning to a job and buying everything on credit
I see so many young couples to get married and trap themselves into a Lifestyle that would not let them get out of that for most of their working years
for many people just as the Last Child leaves home the parents realise they have not adequately prepared for retirement and they begin to scramble to put
and they find themselves with no responsibilities so what kind of Assets and I suggesting
you are your children acquire in my world real assets fall into the following categories businesses that do not require
I own them but their managed or run by other people if I have to work there it's not a business it becomes my job
bonds income generating real estate notes are used for intellectual

As a young boy by educated dad encourage me to find the safe job for my Rich Dad encourage me to begin acquire in asset
I loved if you don't love it you won't take care of it I collect real estate simply because I love buildings and land I love
and I can look at them all day long one problems arise the problems are so bad that it changes my love for real estate for people who ha
state they should buy I also love stars of small companies especially startups because I am an entrepreneur not a corporate person
in my early years I worked in large organisations such as standard oil of California the US Marine Core and xerox Corporation
enjoyed my time with those organisations and have fund memories but I know deep down I am not a company man I like studying companies not
so my stock price are usually of small companies sometimes I even start the company and take a public
Turkish shoes and I love the game many people are afraid of small cap companies and call them risky and they are there risk is diminished
if you love with the investment is understand it and know the game with small companies my investment strategy is to be out of the stock in a year
on the other hand my real estate strategy is to start small and keep trade enough for bigger properties and therefore delay pain taxes on the game
this allows the value to increase dramatically a generally hold real estate less than 7 years for years even while
I did with my Rich Dad recommended I kept my day job but I still minded my own business I was active in my
count trading real estate and small stocks Rich Dad always trust the importance of financial literacy the battery was it understand in the
cash management and eventually started in building my own company I don't encourage anyone to start
namaste really want to know what I know about running a company I would wish that has gone anyone there are times when people can't find employment
study in the company seems like the best solution to success 9 out of 10 companies fail in 5 years of

as your cash flow grows you can enroll in some luxurious and important
tension is the rich people buy luxurious last for the poor and Middle Class 10th by luxurious first often by Lux
because they want to look rich they look rich but in reality they just get different
turn on credit money people the long term rich build the rest column first then the income generated from the Asset column

it didn't take any extra worker risk and her part because the apartment house but the car she did however have to wait 4 years
but the luxury the Mercedes was a

instead most people and possibly go out and buy a new car or some other luxury on credit
I miss you bored and just want a new toy buying a luxury and credit often causes a person to eventually resented luxury because the Dead
after you taken the time and invested in and build your own business you are now ready to learn the biggest secret of the rich
The Secret that puts the rich way ahead of the Pack chapter 4 lesson 4
history of taxes and the power of corporations by which they are just played the game smart and he did it through cooperation
the biggest secret of the rich I remember in school being told the story of Robin Hood and his merry man my teacher
and gave to the poor by Rich Dad did not see Robin Hood is a hero
Robert may be long gone but his followers live on I often still here people say why
the rich should be more in taxes and give it to the poor it is this Robin Hood fancy or taking from the rich
the four that is caused the most pain for the poor and the milk class the reason the middle class is so heavily text is because of the Rob
it's the middle class who pays for the poor especially the educated after income
again to understand fully how things happen we need to look at the history of taxes although my highly educated dad was
my Rich Dad fashion himself an expert on the history of taxes which direct explain to Mike and me that
in England and America there were no taxes occasionally the temporary taxes levied in order to pay for Wars
sing for the president would put the word out and ask everyone to Japan for the fight against Napoleon from 179
1816 and in America to pay for the Civil War from 1861 to 1865 in
74 England made Income Tax a permanent level on its citizens in 1913 and Income Tax became permanent in the United
with the adoption of the 16th amendment to the US Constitution at one time Americans were initiates it had been the tax on
Boston Harbour in incident that helped Ignite the Revolutionary war it took approximately 50 years in both
end the United States to sell the idea of a regular Income Tax what is historical dates fail to reveal is
against only the rich it was this point that Rich Dad wanted Michael meet understand he explained that
and accepted by the majority by telling the poor and the middle class the taxes were created only to punish the r
this is how the message voted for the law and they became constitutionally legal although it was intended to punish the rich in
wonder punishing the very people who worked for the poor and Middle Class once government colleges of money it
your dad and I are exactly opposite he is a government bureaucrats and I am a capitalist we
read an hour success is measured on opposite behaviours he gets paid to spend money and hire people the more he spent and the more people he hi
the larger his organisation becomes in the government a large organisation is a respected Organisation on the other hand
I spend the more I am respected by my investors that's why I don't like
they have different objectives the most business people as the government grows more more Textiles are needed to support it
educated dad sincerely believe the government should help people he loved John F Kennedy and especially the idea of the peace core he
to go to Malaysia Thailand and the Philippines
who is derived for additional grants and budgeting crisis so he could hire more people both in his job with the education department and in the peace Core
from the time I was about 10 years old I would hear from my Rich Dad that government workers were pack of Lazy themes and for my Poor Dad I would hear her
who should be made to pay more taxes both sides and valid points it was difficult to go to work for one of the biggest
town and come home to a father who was a prominent government leader it was not easy to know which dad to believe yet when you study the history
access an interesting perspective emerges as I said the passage of taxes was only possible because the masses believed in the Robert
take from the rich and give to everyone else the problem with the government appetite for money was so great the
you needed to be loved on the middle class and from there it kept trickling down however the rich son of opportunity because they don't
the rich know about corporations which became popular in the days of sailing ships the rich created the
as a vehicle to Limited risk to the Assets of which voyage the richter money into a corporation to finance the voyage the Corporation
sale to the new World to look for treasure if the ship was lost the crew master lives but the last of the rich
could be Limited only to the money they invested for that particular voyage it is the knowledge of the legal corporate structure that really gives
Western advantage over the poor and Middle Class having two fathers teach me one a socialist and the other capitalist a quick
and realise that the philosophy of the capitalist made more financial sense to me it seem to me that the socialist ultimately penalized themselves
lack of financial education no matter what to take from the rich crowd came up with the rich always found a way towards smartphone
intellectuals slowly because they understood the power of money a subject
modern schools how did the rich out smart the intellectuals wants to take from the rich tax was passed cash started flowing
government offers initially people were happy money was handed out to government workers and the rich it went to government workers in the form of jobs
why are the factories receiving government contracts the government received a large pool of money but the problem
the government idea is to avoid having excess money if you fail to spend your audit funds you
you will certainly not be recognised for being efficient business people on the other hand are rewarded for having access
as the cycle of growing government spending continued the demand for money increased and the tax the rich
I was suggested to include lower income levels down to the very people who worked again the poor and the middle class true capitalist
who is the financial knowledge to simplify and escape they headed back to the protection of a corporation but what many people who have never form the cooperation
is there a corporation is not really a thing a corporation is nearly a file folder with some legal documents office
it's not a big building or factory or a group of people a corporation is merely a legal
was once again protected it was popular because the
tax rate of a corporation is less than the individual income tax rates in addition certain expenses could be paid by a corporation with pretext
this war between the hands and have nuts has raised for hundreds of years the battle of wedged whenever and wherever laws are made
go on forever the problem is that the people who lives the ones to get up everyday and divergently go to work
if they only understood the way the rich play the game they could play Too then they would be on their way to their own financial independence
this is why I cringe every time I hear Apparent advise their children to go to school so they can find a safe secure job
today work 5 to 6 months for the government
best computer taxes in my opinion that is simply too long the harder you work the more you pay the government that is why
every time people try to punish the rich the rich don't simply
they have the money power and intent to change things they don't just sit there and voluntarily pay more taxes
the highest murder in accounts and persuade politicians to change loss or
they use their resources to affect change the tax code of the United States also allows other ways to

thanks a missing a great opportunity to build the rest columns the poor and Middle Class don't have the same resources
needles enter their arm and allow the blood donation to begin today I am constantly shocked at the number of people
deductions simply because they are afraid of a government I have friends who have their businesses shut down
destroyed only to find out it was a mistake on the part of the government I realise all that but the price of working from January
is a high price to pay for that intimidation my Poor Dad never fought back my Rich Dad didn't either he just played the game smarter
corporations the biggest secret of the rich you may be member of the first lesson I learnt from my Rich Dad I was a little
and wait for him to choose to talk to me I said in his office waiting for him to get to me he was ignoring me on purpose
you wanted me to recognise his power and to desire to have their power for myself one day during all the years I studied and learn from him
always reminded me the knowledge is power and with money comes great power that requires the right knowledge to keep it and make it multip
without that knowledge the world pushes you around Rich Dad constantly reminded mic and meet at the biggest Bully was not the boss of the
the Taxman will always take more if you let him the first lesson of having money work for you as a
you working for money is all about power if you work for money you give the power to your employer if money works for you
keep the power and control it once we have this knowledge of the power of money working for us he wanted us to be financially smart and not
anyone or anything process around if your Ignite it's easy to be bored if you know what you are talking about you have a fighting chance
that is why he paid so much for smart tax accounts and returns it was less expensive to pay them then to pay the government
just listen to me was be smart and you won't be pushed around us much because he was all about in citizen and because it was
if you know you're right you are not afraid of fighting back even if you are taking on Robin Hood and his beyond of Mary men
my highly educated dad always encourage me to land a good job with a strong Corporation he spoke of the virtues of working your way up
he didn't understand that by Reliance slowly on a particular I would be a double frame making
when I told my Rich Dad of my father's advice he only chuckled why not on the ladder was always said as a young boy
not understand but which statement by own in my own Corporation it was an idea that same time possible and intimidating all the way was excited by
company I would on the point is that if
for my Rich Dad I would have probably followed my educated dance advice it was nearly the occasional reminder of my Rich Dad that kept the idea
on in my own cooperation alive and kept me on a different path by the time I was 15 or 16 I knew it wasn't going to continue down the
my educated dad recommended I didn't know how I was going to do it but I was determined not to head in the direction most of my classmates for heading
that decision changed my life it was not what is that my Rich Dad advice begin to make more sense to me
I was making a lot of money but every time I look at my paycheck I was disappointed
as I became more successful my boss is talked about promotions
it was flattering but I could hear my Rich Dad asking in my ear who are you working for who are you making rich
in 1974 was still an employee for xerox I found my first cooperation and begin mind in my own business there are already
assets in my asset column but now I was determined to focus on making it bigger those pictures with all the deductions made all the
I can see the future if I follow my educated days advice many employer
focusing on my own business and developing assets made
a machine is much money is possible so I could invest in real
why was just said to boom and there were fortunate to be made the more I realised that we were in the beginning stages of a boom the
the more money I made and of course the more deductions came out of my paycheck it was inspiring
I want an out of the employee trap so badly that I would even harder so I could invest more by 1978 I was consistently one of the top
sales people at the company I badly wanted out of the rat race in less than three years I was making more in my real estate Holding Corporation
then I was making it xerox and the money I was making in my asset column in my own cooperation was money working for me not me found in on
main much more sense soon the cash flow from my properties were so strong that my company
my father was spent in my commissions I wasn't I was invested in my conditions in assets
my money was working hard to make more money each dollar in my asset column was a great employee working hard to make more employees and by the
xerox the plan was working and my portion was the proof
using the lesson I learnt from my Rich Dad I was able to get out of the probability and an early age it was made possible because of
without this financial knowledge which I call financial intelligence or financial IQ
my route to financial Independence would have been much more difficult I know teach others in the hope that I may share my knowledge with them I remind

employees earn and get text and then try to live on what is left a corporation earns spend everything it can and
on anything that is left it's one of the biggest legal tax loopholes to reduce their easy to set up and runner expensive if
that are producing good cash flow for example by owning your own Corporation your vacations can be board meetings and Hawaii
memberships are Company expenses most restaurant meals are partially expenses and on and on
but it's done legally with pre tax dollars protection from losses we live in a litigious
everybody wants a piece of your action the rich hide much of their well using vehicles such as corporations and trust to protect their assets from creditors
when someone says about the individual there often made with layers of legal protection and often find that the wealthy person actually owns not
the control everything but only the poor and Middle Class try to on everything and lose it to the government or to fellow citizen
they learnt it from the robinhood story take from the rich and give it to the poor it is not the purpose of this
about to go into the specifics of on in the corporation but I will say that if you want any kind of assets I would consider finding out more

the rest is history a multi billion dollar industry emerged and AT&T was born
the evening news came on right after the story of Alexander Graham Bell on the news was a story of another downsizing at a local company
and complained that the company ownership was unfair a terminated manager of about 45 years of age at his wife and two babies at the
when was begging the Guards to get him talk to the owners to ask if they would reconsider his termination he had just bought a house and was afraid of losing it
the camera focused on his pleading for all the world to see needless To Say It helped my attention I have been teaching profession
1984 it has been a great experience and rewarding one it is also a disturbing profession for I have 17
and I see one thing in common in all of us myself included we all have tremendous potential and we all are blessed
at the one thing that holds all of us back is some degree of self doubt it is not so much the lack of Technical information and houses back
more the lack of self confidence some are more effective than others once we leave school most of us know that it is not so much a matter
in the real world outside of Academics something more than just grades is required I have
many things guts quotes for boys audacity provider cunning during tenacity and brilliance
much more than school grades to inside is one of
there is also the flip side of the character people who could get down on your knees and bag if necessary
after you and Vietnam is a Marine core pilot I got to know both of those characters inside of me intimately one is not better
as a teacher I recognised that it was excessive fear and self doubt that were the greatest tractors of personal genius
it broke my heart to see students know the answers get like the courage to act on the answer often in the real world it's not a smart
in my personal experience your financial genius requires both technical knowledge as well as courage
if there is too strong the genius is suppressed in my classes I strongly urged students to learn to take risks to be bold
I have come to realise that for
comes to the subject of money they would rather play it safe I have had to feel questions such as why take risks
like you why should I become financially literate and I answer just to have more options
huge changes up ahead in the coming years there will be more people just like the young inventor Alexander Graham Bell there will be a 100 people
Bill Gates and hugely successful companies like Microsoft created every year all over the world and there will also be many more bankruptcies
so why power developed in your financial like you no one can answer that but you yeah
I do it because it is the most exciting time to be alive and rather be welcoming change then dreading change
and rather be excited about making millions then worrying about not getting the race this period now is the most exciting time
unprecedented in our world history generations from now people will look back at this period of time and remark at what an exciting year in mustard
it was the death of the old and birth of the new it was full of turmoil and it was exciting so why Bahadur develop

the changes will be faster and more romantic there will be a dramatic increase in the number of new multi millionaires
they are also will be those who were left Behind I find so many people struggling today often work in harder simply because they claim
ideas they want things to be the way they were and there is just change I know people who are losing their jobs or the houses and
sadly they fail to realise that they might be the problem old ideas are there biggest
it is a liability simply because they fail to realise that while that Idea or way of doing something was an asset yesterday

the game was designed to help people learn how many works in
the game they learn about the interaction of the income statement with the balance sheet they learn how cash flows between the two and how the road to 12 is
driving to increase your monthly cash flow from the Asset column to the point that exceeds your monthly expenses once you will complete this

one that is custom made just for you the friend of the woman who left later call to give me an update she set her friend
