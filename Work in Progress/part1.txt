having two days after major choice of contrasting points of view one of our rich man and one of a poor man
I had two fathers a rich one and the poor one was highly educated and intelligent he had a PhD and completed four years
University the University of Chicago and North Western University to do
scholarships the other father never finished the 8th grade both men were
both and substantial incomes get one always struggled financial the other
would become one of the richest man in Hawaii one died leaving tens of millions of dollars to his family charities and his Church
to be paid both men Were Strong and influential both men after me advice
but I did not advise the same things both men believe strongly in education but did not recommend the same course of study
if I had had only one that I would have to accept or reject his advice having two days after me the choice of
and one of a poor man instead of simply accepting or rejecting one or the other I found
comparing and then choosing for myself the problem was that the rich man was not rich yet and the poor man
both are just starting out on their careers and both were struggling with money and families but they had very different
I want to view about money for example one that would say the love of money is the root of all people the other side
As a young boy having two strong fathers both influencing me was difficult I wanted to
the contrast in their points of view particularly about money was so
I began to start thinking for long periods of time about what each was saying
much of my privatization reflecting asking myself questions such as why does he say that and then asking the same question of the other
statement it would have been much easier to simply say yeah he is right I agree with that or to simply reject the point of view
the old man doesn't know what is talking about instead having two days whom I loved forced me to think and ultimately choose
way of thinking for myself as a Process choosing for myself turned out to be much more valuable in the long run then simply acce
aur rejecting a single point of view one of the reasons the rich curvature the forget poor and the middle class struggles in that
is that the subject of money is taught at home not in school most of us learn about money from our parents so what can poor parent
play simply say stain school and study hard the child make graduate with excellent grades but with the
sadly money is not taught in schools schools focus on scholastic
professional skills but not on financial skills this explain how smart bankers doctors and Accountants who earned excellent grades May strug
is do in large part of highly educated politicians and government officials making
today I often wonder what was soon happen when we have millions of people who need financial
they will be dependent upon your families over the government for financial support what will happen when Medicare and social security
run out of money how will the nation survive if teaching children about money continues to be left to parents most of whom will be or already
because I had to influence of fathers I learnt from both of them I had to think about each day's advice
I gained valuable insight into the power and the fact of one's thoughts on one's life for example one that had a
saying I can't afford it the other dad for bed those words to be used he insisted I ask how can I afford it
bone is a statement and the other is a question one lets you off the hook and the other forces you to think my so
automatically stay in the words I can't afforded your brain stops working by asking the question
can I afford it your brain is put to work he did not mean that you should buy everything you want he was fanatical about exercising your mind
the most powerful computer in the world he said my brain gets stronger everyday because I exercise it the stronger I get the
money I can make he believed that automatically saying I can't afford it was a sign of mental laziness also
and the other had a habit of exercise in his
the long term result was that one that grow stronger financial and the other grow weaker it is not much different from a person
close to the gm to exercise on a regular basis for someone who sits on the couch watching television proper physical exercise increases your
for health and proper mental exercise increases your chances for wealth my two days had opposing attitude and
what is the weather thought wanted the rich should pay more in taxes to take care of those less fortunate the other side
punish those who produced and reward those who don't produce one that recommended study hard so you can find a good company to work for
The Other recommended study hard so you can find a good company to buy one dad said the reason I'm not rich
the other side the reason I must be rich is because I have you kids one encouraged talking
money in business at the dinner table while the other for the subject of money to be discussed over a meal one said when it comes to money
safe don't take risks the other side learn to manage risk one believed our home is our largest investment
The Other believed my house is a liability and if your house is your largest investment you are in trouble
one that believed in a company or
taking care of you and your needs he was always concerned about parents retirement plans medical benefits sick leave vacation
he was impressed with two of his uncle to join the military and earn their retirement and entitlement package for life after 20 years
he loved the idea of medical benefits and PX privileges the military provided its retires he
love the tenure system available through the university the idea of job protection for life and job benefits seem to more important at times
in the job he would often say I worked hard for the Government and I am in title to these benefits The Other believed in
financials of Reliance he spoke out against the entire mentality and how it created weak and financially needy people he was emp
about the infinitely competent struggle to save a few dollars The Other create investments one day Tommy how to
The Other taught me how to write strong business and financial plans so I could create jobs
product of two strong dads allowed me the luxury of a observing the effects different thoughts have on one's life I noticed that people really
for example my poor dad always said I'll never be rich and their privacy
my Rich Dad on the other hand always referred to himself as rich he would say things like I am a rich
in which people don't do this even when he was flat broke after a major financial setback he continued to refer to himself as a rich man
he would cover himself by saying there is a difference between being poor and being broke broke is temporary poor is e
my Poor Dad would say I am not interested in money or money doesn't matter by Rich Dad always said money is power
the power of our thoughts may never be measured or appreciated but it became obvious to me as a young boy that it was important to be a
my thoughts and how I expressed myself I noticed that my Poor Dad was poor not because of the amount of money heard which was significant
but because of his thoughts and actions As a young boy having two fathers I became a clear way of being careful about which data
should I listen to my Rich Dad or to my Poor Dad although both men had tremendous respect for education
the discrete about what they thought was important to learn one wanted me to study hard earned degree and get a good job to earn money
he wanted me to study to become a professional and attorney or an account and to go to business school for my MBA the other enco
study to be rich to understand how many works and to learn how to have a work for me I don't work for money or words he would
at the age of 9 I decided to listen to and learn from my Rich Dad about money
in doing so I chose not to listen to my Poor Dad even though he was the one with all the college degrees a lesson
Robert Frost is my favourite poet all the my love many of his poems my favourite is the road not taken
I use it lesson almost daily the road not taken two roads diverged in a yellow wood and sorry
and be one Traveller long I stood and looked down one as far as I could to wear a band in the undergrowth
then took the other is justice fear and have been perhaps the better claim because it was grassy and wanted wear though as for
about the same and both that morning equally like in leaves no step had Run black
oh I kept the first for another day at knowing how will leads on to way I doubted if I should ever come back I
challenges with the sky some more ages and ages hands two roads diverged in a word and I took the one was travelled by
and that has made all the difference and that has made all the difference over the years I have often reflected upon Robert
phone choosing not to listen to my highly educated that advice and attitude money was a painful decision but it was a decision
read the rest of my life once I made up my mind about whom to listen to my education about money begin my Rich Dad heart
39 years old he stopped once he realised that I knew and fully understood what he had been trying
come into my often fix call money is one form of power but what is more powerful is financial education
money comes and goes but if you have the education about how many works you gain power over it and can be gained building well the
Positive Thinking alone does not work this because most people want to school and never learn how many works so they spend their lives working for money
because I was only 9 years old when I started the lessons my Rich Dad taught me with simple and when it was also done they were only
main lessons repeated over 30 years this audio book is about those six lessons put as simply as possible
recently is my Rich Dad put for those lessons to me the lessons are made not to be answers but guide post that will assist you and your
no matter what happens in a world of increasing change and uncertainty
chapter 1 lesson 1 the rich don't work for money the poor and the middle class work for money the rich have money work
that can you tell me how to get rich my dad put down the evening paper why do you want to get rich son
today jimmy's mom's drop up in the new catalogue and they were going to the beach house for the weekend he took three of his friends but I can I work invited the
they did my dad asked in courageously yeah they did I replied in her town
my dad simulation has pushed his glasses of the British nose and one back to read in the paper I stood waiting for an answer
the year was 1956 I was 9 years old by some Twist of Fate I attended the same Public School with a rich people
we were primarily a sugar plantation town the managers of the plantation and the other airplane people such as doctors business owners and
Centre children to this elementary school after grade 6 their children were generally sent out private schools because my family
one side of the street I want to the school had I lived on the other side of the street I would have gone to a different school with kids from families more like
after grade 6 these kids and I would go on to the public intermediate in High School there was no private school for them or for me
my dad finally put on the paper I can tell he was thinking well soon he began slowly if you want to be rich
I have to learn to make money how do I make money I asked while use your head son he said smiling even then
that's all I am going to tell you over I don't know the answer so don't embarrass me a partnership is formed
the next morning I told my best friend Mike what my dad had said as best as I can tell Mike and I really poor kids in the school
Mike was also in the school by twisted fate someone had run a job in the line for the School district and we wound up in school with the rich kids
new bicycles new everything
food and shelter and clothes but that was about it my dad used to say if you want something work for
we want to thanks but there is not much work available for 9 year old boys so what do we do to make money my guest I don't
I said but do you want to be my partner he agreed and so on that Saturday morning might became my first business partner
we spend all morning coming up with ideas on how to make money occasionally we talked about all the cool guys at jimmy's beach house having fun at
was good because it inspired us to keep thinking of a way to make money finally that afternoon or both of lightning Strike
it was an idea my God from a science book he had read excitedly we should hands and the partnership now had a business for the next

on top of that I had not seen mic stand for Saturday I am quitting I told Michael Lun

I was ready to face my dad even my real dad was angry with him my real dad the one I call the poor one
start my Rich Dad was violating child labour laws and should be investigated my educated Poor Dad told me to domain but I deserve
25 cents an hour my Poor Dad told me that if I do not get a race I was to quit immediately you don't need that the
indignation at 8:00 Saturday morning I walked through the door of Mike's house when my dad opened
take a seat and waiting line he said as I entered he turned and disappeared into his little office next to a bedroom I looked around the room
I didn't see my anywhere feeling awkward a cautiously sat down next to the same two women who were there four weeks earlier the smile and
accounts to make room for me 45 minutes One By And I was steaming the two women had made with him and left 30 minutes earlier
20 minutes and was also gone the house was empty and here I said in a Masti dark living room on a beautiful Sunny Leone
waiting to talk to a cheap skate who exploited children I could hear him wrestling around the office talking on the phone and ignoring me
I was ready to work out but for some reason I said finally 15 minutes later at exactly 9:00 Rich Dad what
said nothing and signal with his hand for me to enter I understand you want to raise over your going to quit Rich Dad
well you're not keeping your end of the burger I blurted out nearly and tears it was really fighting for me
you said that you will teach me if I work for you well I've worked for you I worked hard I have given up my baseball games to work
things you are you greedy you want all the
and don't take care of your employees you make me wait and don't show me any respect I am only a little boy but I deserve to be treated better
not bad he said in less than a month you sound
most of my employees what I asked not understanding what he was saying I continue with my grievance I thought you were going to
instead you want to talk to me that's cool that's really cool I am teaching you Rich Dad
what have you taught me nothing I said I am really you haven't even talk to me once since I agree to work for peanuts 10
I should notify the government about you we have child labour laws you know my dad works for the government you know wow
sandwich dad now you sound just like most of the people who used to work for me the fire or who have quit so
you have to say I demanded feeling pretty pray for a little kid you like me I worked for you and you have not kept your word you haven't taught me
how do you know that I have not taught you anything else to Rich Dad comedy well you have never talk to me I worked for three week
well yes I reply
that's how they teach you in school he said smiling but there is not how life teaches you and I would say that life is the best teacher award
most of the time life does not talk to you it just sort of pushes you around each push is life saying wake up there
what is this man talking about I ask myself silently life pushing me around was life talking to me
I was talking to someone who needed to be locked up if you learn life lessons you will do well
people do two things some just let life push them around others get
push back against the boss or the job or their husband or wife they do not know it's life that's pushing
I had no idea what he was talking about life pushes all of us around some people give up and others fight a
turn the lesson and move on they welcome life pushing them around to these few people it means they need and want to learn something
they learn and move on most quit in the few like you fight Rich Dad stored in short the crackle wooden window that needed
if you learn this lesson you will grow into a wise wealthy and Happy Young man if you don't you will spend your life
all your money problems
Rich Dad look over me to see if I was still listening his eyes met mine we stay at Each Other communicating through
finally I looked away once I had absorbed his message I knew he was right I was believe in him and I did asked
I was fighting Rich Dad continued over if you are the kind of person who has no guts you just give up every time
doing the right things saving yourself for some event that
happens when you die a born old man you have lots of friends who really like you because you are such a nice hard working guy
do you like push you into submission deep down your terrified of taking risks you really wanted to
but the fear of losing was greater than the excitement of winning deep inside you and only you will know you didn't go for it
to play it safe our eyes medicine around I asked some people might say that
I would say that I just gave you a taste of life what taste of life I asked still angry but now curious
you boys are the first people that have ever asked me to teach them how to make money I have more than 100
and one of them has asked me what I know about money they ask me for a job and the pay check but never to teach them about money so
how to spend the best years of their lives working for money not really understanding what it is they are working for I said there are listening
so when my told me you want to learn how to make money I decided to design a course that made real life I could talk and
so I decided to let life push you around a bit so you could hear me that's why I only paid
so what is the lesson I learnt from working for only 10 cents an hour I asked that your cheap and explore your workers
which day walked back and left hardly finally he said you best change your point of view stop blaming me and
the problem if you think I am the problem that you have to change me if you realise that you are the problem then you can change
learn something and grow wiser most people want everyone else in the world to change but themselves let me tell you
it's easier to change yourself then everyone else I don't understand I said don't blame me for your problems Rich Dad
but you only pay any 10 sets so what are you learning Rich Dad asked smiling that your cheap I said
migraine see you think I am the problem Set Rich Dad but you are well keep their attitude and you will learn nothing
keep the attitude that I am the problem and what choices do you have well if you don't pay me more or show me more respect and teach me how
welfare Rich Dad said and that's exactly what most people do liquid and go looking for another job a better
actually thinking that this will solve the problem then most cases it won't so what should I do
I asked just take this weekends an hour and smile Rich Dad smile that's what the other people do but that's all they
waiting for race thinking that more money will solve your problems most just accepted and some take a second job work in harder
accepting a small page check I said steering at the floor beginning to understand the lesson Rich Dad was present in I could
it was a taste of life finally I looked up and asked so what will stop the problem this he said leaning forward and
on the head this stuff between your ears it was at that moment the Rich Dad share the people
which separated him from his employees and my product and led him to eventually become one of the richest man in Hawaii
highly educated but Poor Dad struggle financial all his life it was a singular point of view that made all the difference of their life
Rich Dad said this point of view over and over which I call lesson number 1 the poor and the middle class work for
the rich have money work for them on that bright Saturday morning I learn the completely different point of view from what I had been
at the age of 9 I understood that both dad wanted me to learn to study but not
thanks my highly educated that recommended that I do what he did son I want you to study hard get good grades so you
company and make sure it has excellent benefits my Rich Dad wanted me to learn how many works
I can make it work for me these lessons I would learn through life with his guidance not because of a classroom my Rich Dad
continue my first lesson I am glad you got angry about working for 10 seconds and hour if you hadn't got angry and hit I would have
you see through learning text energy passion and a burning Desire anger is a big part
passion is anger and love combined when it comes to money most people want to play safe and feel secure so
fashion does not direct them fear does viral take jobs with low pay I asked yes celebrate
some people say I exploit people because I don't pay as much as the sugar plantation or the government I say the people exploit themselves
don't you feel you should pay the more I asked I don't have to you and besides more money will
the problems just look at your dad he makes a lot of money and he still can't pay his bills most people given more money
get into more that so that's why the tensions in our I said smiling it's part of the lesson that's right smile
you see your dad want to school and got an excellent education so he could get a high paying job but he still has money problems
never learn anything about money in school on top of that he believes in working for money and you don't I asked now
if you want to learn to work for money then stay in school that is a great place to learn to do that but if you want
how to have money work for you then I will teach you that but only if you want to learn would everyone want to learn that I asked
no set Rich Dad simply because it's easier to learn to work for money especially if fear is your primary emotion when the subject of money
I don't understand I said but the phone don't worry about that for now just know that it's most people
the fear of not paying the bills the fear of being fired the fear of not having enough money and the fear of starting over
that's the price of studying to learn a professional trade and then working for money most people become a Slave To
and then get angry at the boss learning to have money work for you is a completely different course of study I asked
absolutely we set in the silence on the beautiful lines for friends had just
League baseball game but for some reason I was now thankful I had decided to work for 10 cents an hour I sent that I was about to learn
my friends would learn in school ready to learn as to Rich Dad absolutely I said but again I have kept my prom
has been teaching you from a farmer Rich Dad said at 9 years old you got the taste of what it feels like to work for money just
50 years and you will have an idea of what most people spend their life doing I don't understand I said
how did you feel waiting in line to see me wants to get hired and wants to ask for more money terrible I said if
used to work for money that is what life would be like that and how did you feel when Mrs modern draught three times in your hand for 3
I thought like it wasn't enough it seem like nothing I was disappointed I said and that is how most emplo
especially after all the tax and other deductions are taken out at least you got 100%
everything I asked with a measurement heavens no service that the government always takes it shares first
how do they do that I asked taxes should Rich Dad your text when you earn your text when you spend
when you save your text when you die why do people left the government do that to them the rich don't set
the poor and the middle class 2 more than you that he has more in taxes how can I
I asked at my age that may no sense to me why would someone like the government do that to them rich
ready to learn he asked I not in my head slowly as I said
learning how to have money work for you is a lifetime study most people go to college for 4 years and their education
I already know that my study of money will continue over my lifetime simply because the more I find out the more I find out I need to know
most people never study the subject they go to work get their pay check balance the cheque books and that's it then they wonder why they have
problems they think that more money will solve the problem and don't realise that it's their lack of financial education that is the problem
so my dad has tax problems because he doesn't understand money I asked confused look sandwich dad taxes are just one
section on learning how to have money work for you today I just wanted to find out if you still have the passion to learn about money most people
I want to go to school learn a profession have fun at their work and earn lots of money one day they wake up with big money problems
that's the price of only knowing how to work for money instead of studying how to have money work for you so
still have the passion to learn as to Rich Dad I not in my head good for Rich Dad now get back to work this time
I will pay you nothing what I asked in amazement you hurt me nothing you will work the same 3 hours every Saturday
at this time you will not be paid and sense for our you said you want to learn to not work for money so I am not going to pay you anything
believe what I was hearing I have already had this conversation with mic and he's already working Dustin and stacking can goods for free you better
