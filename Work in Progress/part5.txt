how many of you can cook a better hammer of the McDonald's almost all the students raise their hands and then ask so is most of you can
McDonald's is excellent business systems the reason
how many time to people are poor is because they focus on building a better hamburger and no little to nothing about business systems a friend
called to tell him that she had left him 35000
that is what was left of our state after the Attorney and the government took their shares immediately his own opportunity to increase
by using some of this money to advertise two months later his first four colourful pages appeared in an expensive

Hina wants to see the magazine for Mr representation this is a common case of someone who can build a beautiful hamburger
when I asked him what he learnt his only reply was advertising sales people are Crooks and then
if you will be willing to take a course in sales and the course and direct marketing his reply I don't have the time and I don't want to waste my money
the world is filled with talented poor people also often therefore or struggle financial
because of what they know but because of what they do not know they focus on perfect in your skills and building a better hamburger rather than ski
maybe McDonald's does not make the best hamburger but they are the best at selling and delivery in a basic
for dad wanted me to specialised that was his view on how to be paid more even after being told by the Governor
government by educated that continue to encourage me to get specialised educated that then took up the cause
campaigning for further protection and benefits for these highly skilled and educated professionals we argued often but I know he never
specialisation is what caused the need for Union protection he never understood that the more specialised you become the more
trapped independent on that special day which date advised the Merchandise groomer sounds many corporations do the same

the most important specialised skills are sales and marketing the ability to sell to communicate to another human being the customer
employee Boss spouse or child is the basic skill of personal success communication skills such as writing speak
in negotiating a crucial to a life of success these are skills and work on constantly attending courses or buying educational resources
to expand my knowledge as I have mentioned my educated that work harder and harder the more competent he became he also became
trapped the more specialised to God although his salary WhatsApp status diminished soon after he was locked out of government work
it is like professional athlete who suddenly are injured or too old to play their
my pain position is gone and they have limited skills to fall back on I think that is why my education started so much with the unions after that
he realised how much Union would have benefited him Rich Dad encouraged Michael me to know a little about a lot
smart people together to work as a team today it will be called the Synergy of professional
today I mean X school teachers on in hundred thousand Dollars a year they earn that much because they have specialised skills in their field
they can teach as well as hell and market I know of no other skills to be more important than selling and marketing
skills of selling and marketing are difficult for most people primarily due to their fear of rejection the better you are communicating negotiating and
who wanted to become a best selling Author I advised anyone else
the international specialised as it as well as its weaknesses I have friends who are geniuses but they can

we need to be good teachers as well as good students to be truly rich we need to be able to give as well as to receive
in cases of financial or professional struggle there is often a lack of giving and receiving I know many people who are poor because they are needed
nor good teachers both of my dad's were generous man both made a practice to give first teaching
another ways of giving the more they gave the more they received one gram difference within the given of money my Rich Dad gave
he gave to his Church to charities and to his Foundation he knew that to receive money you had to give money given
is the secret to most great wealthy families that is why they are organisations like the Rockefeller foundation and the Ford foundation these
organisations designed to take their wealth and increased as well as given away in perpetuity my educated that always said when I
some extra money I give it the problem was that there was never any extra so he worked harder to draw more money in rather than focus
most important law of money give and you shall receive instead he believed in receive and then you give

overcoming obstacles the primary difference between a rich person and a poor person is how they manage fear
people have studied and become financially literate they may still face roblox to be coming financially independent there are five main reasons why financial
abundant asset columns that could produce a large cash flow the five reasons are one fear
two cynicism three laziness for bad habits 5 ears
overcoming fear I have never met anyone who really likes losing money and then all my years I have never me
person who has never lost money but I have made a lot of poor people who have never lost a time investing that is the fear of
everyone has it even the rich but it's not having fear that is the problem it's how you handle fear it how you
it's how you handle failure that makes the difference in one's life the primary difference between a rich person and a poor
is how they manage that fear it's OK to be fearful it's OK to be a covered when it comes to money you can still be rich
we are all heroes at something and covers at something else my friends wife is an emergency room nurse when she sees blood
when I mentioned investing she runs away when I see blood I don't run I pass out my
understood phobias about money some people are terrified of snakes some people are terrified about losing money both are phobias
so his solution to the phobia of losing money was this little rhyme if you hate risk and worry start early
it's easier to be rich I won't go into it here but there is a staggering difference between a person who started investing at age 20 forces
is said to be one of the greatest burgers of all time New York was purchased for 24 hours in cricket
if that $24 had been invested at 8% annually that 24 dollars would have been worth more than
trillion dollars by 1995 could be reproduced with money left over to buy much of Los Angeles
if you don't have much time left or would like to retire early how do you handle the fear of losing money my Poor Dad did nothing
recently awarded the issue refusing to discuss the subject by Rich Dad on the other hand recommended that I think like a taxon
I like Texas and Taxes he used to say in Texas everything is bigger one taxes when they win Big and when the
its spectacular they like losing I asked that's not what I am saying nobody likes losing show me a happy loser
reward and failure I am talking about it's how
not like most of the people around here living comes to money terrified that someone was shining light on them
which state one on what I like best is the taxes attitude their
when they lose taxes have the same if you are going to go broke go big you don't want to meet you and Broke over
he constantly told Michael me that the greatest reason for lack of financial success was because most people played to safe
it still another
winning means being on afraid to lose in my own life I have noticed that winning usually follows losing before I
learn to ride a bike I first fell down many times I have never made a call for who has never lost the Golf ball I have never met people who have found
who have never had their heart broken and I've never met someone rich who has never lost money so for most people the reason
information is because the pain of losing money is far greater than the joy of being rich another scene in taxes
one wants to go to heaven but no one wants to die most people dream of being rich but a terrified of losing money so they never get to he
which tag used to tell Michael me stories about his trips to Texas if you really want to learn the attitude of how to handle risk losing and
go to San Antonio and visit the element the element is a great story of brave people who chose to fight knowing there was no
of success they chose to die instead of surrendering it's an inspiring story of study nonetheless
tragic military defeat the guitar but kicked so how to taxes handle failure they still shout remember
why can I heard the story a lot he always told us the story when he was about to go into a big deal and he was nervous
after he had done all his due diligence and it was time to put up or shut up he told us the story every time he was afraid of making a mistake
losing money he told us the story it gave him strength for reminded him that he could always turn off financial loss into a financial
which state news that failure would only make him stronger and smarter it's not that he wanted to lose he just knew who
and how he would take a loss he would take a loss and make it a win that's what made him a winner and others losers
that's why I like talking so much he would say they took a great failure and
can you inspiration as well as a tourist destination that makes them millions but probably his words that mean the most meat today of these
they get inspired by them they take their failures and turn them into rally in Christ failure inspi
to become winners but that formula is not just the formula protections it is the formula for all winners I said
turn off my bike was part of learning to ride I remember falling of only made me more determined to learn the ride not less I also said
who has never lost the ball for top professional golfers losing a boy or a tournament provides the inspiration to be better
to practice harder to study more that's what makes them better for winters losing inspires them for losers
I like to call John Deere who said I always tried to turn every disaster into an opportunity
has been Japanese American I can say this many people say the pro Harbour was an American mistake I say it was a Japanese
from the movie Tora Tora Tora a sambar Japanese animal cells to his children subordinates I am afraid we have awaken
greatest losses into the reason to win
this great to see gave America strings and the miracles soon emerged as a world power failure inspired
it is the biggest secret of winners it's the secret that losers do not know the greatest secret of
is that failure inspired women afraid of losing weight in front load winning means being on afraid
people like for entertainment are not afraid of losing because they know who they are they hate losing so they know that losing you only
fire them to become better there is a big difference between head and losing and being afraid to lose most people are so afraid of losing money
duplex financially they play Life to safe and too small play by big houses and
the main reason that over 90% of the American public struggles financially is because they play not to lose
they don't play to win they go to their financial planners or accounts or stock brokers and buy a balanced portfolio
WhatsApp cash in CDS lower bounds Mutual Funds that can be treated with in a mutual fund family and a few individual stocks it is
insensible portfolio but it is not a winning portfolio it is a Portfolio of someone playing not to lose
don't get me wrong it's probably a better portfolio of the more than 70% of the population has and that's frightening it's a great portfolio
investment portfolio is not the way successful investors play the game if you have
money and you want to be rich you must first be focused not balanced if you look at any successful person at the start they were not bounced
balanced people don't know where they stay in one spot to make progress you must first go on balanced just look at how you make
Thomas Edison was not balanced he was focused Bill Gates was not balanced he was focused Tamil TR
George pattern did not take his thanks wide he focused them and blue through the weak spots in the German line
the French one word with the imaginary line and you know what happened to them if you have any desire to be rich you must focus
put their few eggs in many baskets put a lot of your eggs in a few baskets and focus
follow one course and tell successful if you hate losing play it safe if losing makes you weak play it safe
balanced investments if you're over 25 years old and a terrified of taking risks don't change plate safe but start early
but if you have dreams of freedom of getting out of the rat race the first
how do I respond to failure if failure inspires you to win maybe you should go for but only maybe
is failure makes you weak or causes you to throw Temple Like spoil brands to call a turn is the fire losses every time something doesn't go their way
keep your day time job or by bands or Mutual Funds but remember there is a risk in those financial in
even though they may appear safe I say always mention any taxes in front of Indian because stack in the Asset column
It's really a low aptitude game it doesn't take much education fifth grade maths will do but building your asset column is a game
Airtel plays a major role it takes guts patients and a great attitude towards failure losers of void feeling and

you don't know why you talking about these words of doubt often get so loud that we fail to act a horrible feeling build

sometime ago a friend name Richard came from Boston to visit Camry in Phoenix he was impressed
the Phoenix real estate prices for depressed we spend today show in Hindi action and opportunities for cash
and capital appreciation human eye are not real estate agents we are strictly investors after I didn't find a unit
the price was a mirror 42000 for two bedroom Town Hall similar unit
he had found a bargain excited he bought it and returned to Boston two weeks later the
I call the immediately to find out why all he said was that he talked to his never and his neighbour told him it was a bad De
he was paying too much I asked Richard it is never was an investor Richard study was not when I asked why he listen to him
defensive and simply said he wanted to keep looking the real estate market in Phoenix turned and a few years later that little unit was written for 1000
2500 in the winter months the unit was worth 95000 all which would have to put
$5000 and he would have had to start at getting out of the rat race today he still has done nothing Richards back in out did
surprise me it's called buyers remorse and it affects all of us the little chicken one at a chance at freedom was lost in another
I hold a small portion of my assets in excel in certificates instead of CDS I earn 16% per year on my money which cer
teach the interest rates banks offer on CDS the certificates are secured by real estate and enforced by State Law which is also better than most banks
the formula the Boron makes them safe they just like liquidity so I look at them as 2 to 7 years CDS
almost every time I tell someone that I hold my money this way especially if they have money in CDS they will tell me it's risky they tell me why I
when I ask them where they get there formation the safe from my friend or an investment magazine they have never done it and they're tell
what is dominated why they should the lowest yield I look for is 16% but people who are filled with doubt are willing to accept for
doubt is expensive my point is that it's those doubts and services they keep most people poor and playing it safe
the real world is simply waiting for you to get rich only a person's doubts keep them poor as I said getting out of the
it doesn't take much education but those doubts are Kepler's for most people sin x never wins at which dead
unchecked down in fear creates a snake Phoenix criticize and winners analyse was another of his favourite Saints which
explain the criticism blinded analysis open dice analysis to see the credit for blind and to see opportunities
and finding my people miss is keep any success real estate is a powerful investment to offer anyone seek
Independence over freedom it is a unique investment to work at every time I mentioned real estate as a vehicle I often here I don't want
toilets that's what people lunch cause noise that's what my Rich Dad would say is disconnect talking someone who criticizes and does not
someone who loves their doubts and fears close their mind instead of open your eyes so when someone says I don't want to fix toilet
want to fire back what makes you think I want to listen a toilet is more important than what they want to talk about freedom from the
where is the top pattern to keep the most people poor the criticize instead of analyse
hold the key to your success Rich Dad would say because I too do not want to fix toilets I shop hard for property manager
does fixed toilets and by finding a great property manager who runs houses or Apartments well my cash flow goes up but more importantly
I don't have to fix toilets a great property manager is key to success in
finding a good manager is more important to me than the real estate a great property manager often hears of great deals before real esta
which makes them even more valuable that is what Rich Dad made by I don't want to hold the key to your success because
I do not want to fix to your I figured out how to buy more real estate and expedite my getting out of the rat race the people who continue
I don't want to fix Twilight of internet themselves the use of this powerful investment vehicle toilet are more important than their freedom
in the stock market I often hear people say I don't want to lose money well what makes them think I or anyone else likes losing
they don't make money because they choose to not lose money instead of analysing they close their Minds to another powerful investment vehicle
the stock market I was writing with a friend gas station he looked up and saw that the price of gas was going up and
to him the sky is always going to fall and usually
on him when we got home he showed me all the states as to why the price of oil was going to go up with the next few years stat
even though I already owned substantial shares of an existing oil company with their information I am immediately begin
info and found a new undervalued oil company that was about to find some all the passwords my broker was excited about this new company and
15000 shares for 65 cents per share 3 months later the same friend and I dropped by the same gas station and
had gone up nearly 15% again the Chicken Little worried and complained I smile because a
15000 shares one up to more than $3 per share since he had first given me the tip
and the price of gas will continue to grow up if what my friends as is true if most people understood how to stop work and
there would be more people investing to win instead of investment to lose a staff is simply a computer command that sells
start automatically if the price begins to drop helping to minimise your losses and maximize some games it's a great tool for those who are terrified
so whenever I hear people focusing on their I don't wants rather than what they do want I know the noise and their head must be loud
take a little has taken over their brain and his yelling the sky is falling and toilets are breaking so they avoid they don't want but they pay
price they may never get what they want in life instead of analysing their inner Chicken Little closes their mind Rich Dad gave

overcoming laziness busy people are often the most lazy we have already stories of a businessman who works hard
the office and brings work home and weekends one day he comes
turn off the house his wife has left with the kids he knew he and his wife had problems but rather than work to make the relationship strong he said busy
This made his performance works lips and he loses his job today I often meet people who are too busy to take care of their well
and there are people too busy to take care of their health the cause is the same they are busy and they stay busy as a way of avoiding something that you
I want to face nobody has to tell them deep down they know in fact If you remind them they often respond with anger or irritation
if they are busy at work or with the kids there often busy watching TV fishing playing of for shopping at deep down
that's the most common form of laziness laziness by staying busy so what is the
laziness the answer is a little greed for many hours we were raised thinking of greed or Desire is bad
this evening to have nice knew or exciting things
motion of Desire under control of an pairs find ways of suppressing the Desire with killed you only think about yourself don't you know you have
brothers and sisters was one of my mom's favourite you want me to buy you what was your favourite of my dad do you think we are made of money do you think money grows
trees were not rich people you know it was so much the word but the angry girl trip to one with the words that got me or the
I am sacrifice in my life to buy this for you I am buying this for you because I never had this advantage when I was a kid I have a neighbour
car in his garage is filled with toys for his kids those spoil breath get everything
I don't want them to know the feeling of want or his everyday words he has not been satisfied for their college or his retirement but is kids
he recently got a new credit card in the mail and took his kids to visit Las Vegas I am doing it for the kids he said with
Rich Dad for bed the words I can't afford it in my real home that's all I heard instead which that
children to say how can I afford it he believed that the words I can't afford it shut down your brain it didn't have to think
how can I afford it opened up the brain and forced to think and search for answers but most importantly he felt the words
and the human spirit knows it the human spirit is very very powerful he would say it know
it can do anything by having a lazy mind it says I can't afford it a war breaks out inside you your spirit is angry and you are la
must defend its life the sphere is screaming come on let's go to the German workout and the lazy mind says but I am tired
I am second tired of being poor let's get out there and get rich to which the lazy
which people are greedy besides it's too much power is not safe I might lose money I am working hard enough as it is
too much to do it work anyway look at what I have to do tonight my boss wants it finished by morning I can't afford it also
I helplessness the leads to disappointment see and often depression how can I afford it opens up possibilities excitement
so which state was not so concerned about what we wanted to buy as long as we understood that how can I afford it creates a stronger
anything he would instead ask how can you afford it and
college which we paid for ourselves it was not the goal but the process of obtaining the goal that he wanted us to learn the
I see today is that there are millions of people who feel guilty about their desire for their greed it's old conditioning from their childhood
desire to have the final things that life offers most of their condition to subconsciously to say I can't have that or I'll never be able to AF
when I decided to exit the rat race it was simply a question of how can I afford to never work again and my mind
check out answers and Solutions the hardest part was fighting my real parents dogma we can't afford that stop thinking only about yourself
why do you think about others and other similar sentiments designed to install gilt to surprise my grid so how
once again the answer is a little greed is that radio station w iifm which stands for
a person needs to sit down and ask what would my life be like if I never had to work again what would I do if I had all the
I need it without that little green the desire to have something better progress is not made our world progresses because we all
new inventions are made because we Desire something better we go to school and study hard because we want
something better so whenever you find yourself avoiding something you know you should be doing then the only thing to ask yourself is what's in it for me
is the best cure for laziness too much great however as anything in Access can be is not
just remember what Michael Douglas set in the movie Wall Street greed is good which tag is definitely guilt is
do what you feel in your heart to be right
criticized anyway you'll be damned if you do and deemed if you don't overcoming bad habits our
reflection of our habits more than our education after seeing the movie cone in the Barbarian to start another friend said
I love to have a body like shortener most of the guys not it in the comments another friend added
yeah I heard that too another one said I heard he has a habit of working out almost everyday in the gym yeah a very has to
but he was born that way because this is an example
habits controlling behaviour I remember asking my Rich Dad about the habits of the rich instead of answering me out right he wanted me to learn through example
as usual when does your dad face bills Rich Dad I asked the first of the month I said does he have anything left over
very little I said that's the main reason he struggles that Rich Dad he has bad habits your dad is everyone else first
he plays himself last but only if he has anything left over which usually doesn't I said but he has to pay his bills doesn't
you are saying he should face because of course not Rich Dad I firmly believe in pain my bills on time I just pay myself first
even the government for what happens if you don't have enough money I asked what do you do then the same side Rich Dad
to pay myself first even if I'm sort of money my asset column is far more important to me then the government but I said
don't take compared to you yes if you don't pay so that look I did not say not to pay I just said I pay myself first
even if I'm sure of money but I replied how do you do that it's not how the question is why Rich Dad said
Ok why motivation said Rich Dad who do you think will complain louder if I don't pay them me or my creditors
responding to the obvious you would say anything if you didn't pay yourself so you see
after pain myself the pressure to pay my taxes and the other creditors is so great that force is made to seek other forms of income the
play becomes my motivation I want extra jobs started at the companies traded in the stock market anything just to make sure those guys don't start
make me smarter and more active when it comes to money
play myself last I would have said no pressure but I'll be broke so it is the fear of the government or other people you are money to the motivate
you see government will colleges are big bullish so were collected in general most people
and never pay themselves you know the story of the 98 pound weekly who gets sand kept in his face
I see that here for weightlifting and bodybuilding lessons in the comic books all the time while most people left the ball is kick sand in their faces
I decided to use the fear of the body to make me stronger others that weaker force in myself to think about how to make extra money is like
the more I worked my mental money muscles out the stronger I get now I'm not afraid of those police
I like to Rich Dad was saying so if I pay myself first I get financially stronger mentally and physically Rich Dad noted
identify pay myself last or not at all I get weaker so people like bosses managers tax collectors bill collector
push me around all my life just because I don't have good money habits Rich Dad noted just like the 98 pound
overcoming organs what I know makes me money what I don't know loses me money
every time I have been arrogant I have lost money because one American I truly believe that what I don't know is not important Rich Dad but after
I have found that many people user against to try to hide their own ignorance it often happens when I am discussing financial statements with
or even other investors they try to blaster the way through the discussion it is clear to me that they don't know what they're talking about
but they are not telling the truth there are many people in the world of money finances and investments who have absolutely no idea
they're talking about most people on the money industry are just starting of sales pitches like used car salesman when you know you are ignorant
start educating Yourself by finding an expert in the field or a book on the subject
getting started there is gold everywhere most people are not trained to see it I wish I could say a query
easy for me but it wasn't So In response to the question how do I start I offer the thought process I go through on a day to day
it really is easy to find great deals I promise you that it's just like riding a bike after a little bubbling it's a piece
but when it comes to money it takes to determination to get through the wobbling that's a personal thing to find million dollar deals of
I believe that each of us has a financial genius within us the problem is that our financial
it lies to sleep because our culture has educated us in the believe in that the love of money is the root
it has increased to learn a profession so we can work for money but fail to teachers how to have money work for US
not to worry about our financial future because our company or the government would take care of us one hour working days are over however it is
educated in the same school system who will end up pain for this absence of financial education the message is still to work hard
money and spend it and when we run short we can always borrow more unfortunately 90% of the Western world
simply because it's easier to find a job and work for money if you are not one of the masses I offer you the
10 steps to awaken your financial genius I simply offer you the steps I have personally followed if you want to follow some of them
if you don't make up your own you are financial genius is smart enough to develop its own list while improve I

I offer you the following 10 steps as a Process to develop your god given powers powers over which only
you have control one find the reason greater than reality the power of spirit
you ask most people if they would like to be rich or financially free they would say yes but then reality sets in the road seems too long
which too many Hills to climb it's easier to just work for money and hand the access over to your broker I want many young woman who had
names of swimming for the US Olympic team the reality was that she had to get up every morning at 4:00 to swim for 3 hours before going to
she did not party with her friends on Saturday night she had to study and keep a great job just like everyone else when I ask her
sacrifice she simply said I do it for myself and the people I love it's love that gets me over the hurd
sacrifices a reason for purpose is a combination of wants and don't wants when people ask me what my reason for
to be reaches I tell them that it is a combination of deep emotional wants and don't wants I will list a few first
I don't want to work on my life I don't want what my parents aspired for which was job security
I don't like being an employee I hate it that my dad always miss my football games because he was so busy working
I hate it when my dad work hard all his life and the government took most of what he worked for it is that he could not even pass on
so hard for my dad the rich don't do that they work hard and passed on to their children now the ones I
