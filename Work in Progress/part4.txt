the income statement and balance sheet came from heaven about not understanding them she believes that finishes with the man's job she main
she was now quite certain that in the last five years of their marriage he had money
she was angry at yourself for not being more aware for the money was going as well as for not knowing about the other woman
the world is always providing us with instant feedback we can learn a lot if we don't know one day not long ago
I complaint to my wife that the cleaners must have short my parents my wife Jelly smiled and talk to me in the stomach to inform me that the parents had
something else had expanded me the cash flow game was designed to give every player personal feedback
purpose is to give you options if you draw about card and put you into that the question is now what can you do how many
financial options can you come up with that is the purpose of the game to teach players to think and create new and various financial options
thousands of people throughout the world have played this game the players who get out of the rat race the quickest or the people who understand numbers and have
they recognise different financial options which people are often creative and take calculated risks people who take
are people who are not familiar with numbers and often do not understand the power of investing some people playing cash flow
types of money in the game but they don't know what to do with it even though they have money everyone else seems to be getting ahead of them and that is true in
there are a lot of people who have a lot of money and do not get ahead financial limiting your options is the same is hanging
old ideas I have a friend from high school who Now works at three jobs years ago he was the richest of all my classmates
local sugar plantation closed the company he worked for one down with the plantation in his mind he had but one option and that was the
work hard the problem was that he could find an equivalent job that recognised his seniority from the all company as a result he
to survive
what people playing cash flow complaint at the right opportunity cards are not come in their way I know people who do that in real
the wait for the right opportunity I have watched people get the right opportunity card and then not have enough money then they compla
if they had more money so they said that I know people in real life who do that also
essay on the great deals but they have no money and I have seen people for a great opportunity card read it out loud and have no idea
is a great opportunity they have the money the time is right they have the card but they can see the opportunity steering them in the face they
see how it fits into their financial plan for escape in the rat race and they know more people like that then all the others combined most
have an opportunity of a lifetime flash right in front of them and they fail to see it a year later they find out about it after everyone else
financial intelligence is simply having more options if the opportunities are coming your way what else can you do to
if an opportunity lands in your life and you have no money in the bank phone talk to you what else can you do to get the opportunity
if your heart is wrong and what you've been counting on doesn't happen how can you turn a lemon in the millions that is financial
it is not so much what happens but how many different financial solutions you can think of to turn on lemon into millions it is
most people only no one solution work hard save and borrow
so why would you want to increase your financial intelligence because you want to be the kind of person who creates your luck you take what
happens and make it better few people realise that luck is created just as money is and if you want to be lucky here and create money instead of
hard then you are financial intelligence is important if you are the kind of person who was waiting for the right thing to happen you might wait for a long time
it's like waiting for all the traffic lights to be green for 5 miles before you start your trip as young boys Mike and I
delete all my Rich Dad that money is not real which date occasionally reminded us of how close became to the secret of money on that first day we
making money out of plaster of paris the poor and Middle Class work for money he would say the rich
the harder you work for it if you can grasp the idea that money is not real you will
what is it was a question mark and I often came back with what is money if it is not real
was always there would say the single most powerful asset we all have is our mind if it is trained well a can
enormous wealth seemingly instantaneously and untrained mind can also create extreme poverty that can crush a family for generation
in the information age money is increasing exponentially a few individuals are getting ridiculously rich from nothing just
and agreements if you ask many people who trade stocks or other investments for living they see it down all the time often
can be made instantaneously from nothing and by nothing I mean no money was exchanged it is done via agreement a hand signal
from a trader screen in Toronto and back to Lisbon a call to my broker to buy and a moment later to sell
money did not change hands agreements did so why to develop your financial genius only you can answer that
I can tell you why I have been developed in this area of my intelligence I do it because I want to make money fast not because I need you
I want to it is a fascinating learning process I develop my financial like you because I want to participate in the fastest game and
came in the world and in my own small way I would like to be part of this unprecedented evolution of humanity the year were human
besides it is worthy action is it is what is happening its hip it's
and it's fun that is why I invest in my financial intelligence develop in the most powerful acid I have
I want to be with people moving body forward I do not want to be with those left Behind I will give you a simple example of
the economy of Phoenix Arizona was horrible I was watching the TV show when a financial planner came
American forecasting Doom and gloom his advice was to save money put $100 away every month he said in 40 years
you will be a multi millionaire while putting money away every month is a sound idea it is one option the option most people subscribed to
the problem is this it Blinds the person to what is really going on it causes them to miss major opportunities for much more significant
Germany the world is passed in the boy as I said the economy was terrible at that time for investors this is the perfect
condition a chunk of my money was in the stock market and in the permanent houses I was sure to cash because people were given properties away
I was buying I was not saving money I was investing and I had more than a million dollars in cash working in a market that was Rising
it was the best opportunity to invest the economy was terrible I just could not pass up the small deals
75000 but instead of shopping with local real estate Agencies shopping at the bank
steps in the shopping places at 75000 house could sometimes be bought for 20000 dollars
for $2000 which was loan to me from my friend for 90 days for $200 I gave in a turning a cashier's check as
while the acquisition would be interesting for only 60000
no money down the phone ring hard and heavy prospective buyers for screen and once the property was legally mine all the perspective buyers
how to look at the house it was a feeding Frenzy the household in a few minutes I asked for 2500 processing fee which
I return to 2000 to my friend with an additional $200
and I was happy I had sold the house for 60000 dollars that cost me
the 40000 dollars was created from money in my asset column in the form of a promissory note from the buyer total working
5 hours so now that you are on your way to becoming more financially literate and skill that reading numbers I will tell you
this is an example of money been invented able to do sex of these simple transactions in our
time was the book of our money was in larger properties and the stock market we were able to create more than 1 9 8 0
set 10% interest in those 6 by create and sell transactions that comes to approximately 19000 dollars to your income
much of that 19000 dollars a year goes to pay for a company cars gas strips
and other things by the time the government gets a chance to take their income it's been spent on legally allowed
expenses this was a simple example of how many is invented created and protected using financial intelligence
ask yourself how long will it take to save 190 thousand dollars with the bank pay you 10% interest on your money and the
I have to pay tax if they pay me the principal and besides
is a little over 500 thousand Dollars in income I have people ask what happens if
that does happen and it's good news that 60000 home could be taken back and resolved for 7
and another 2500 collected as a loan processing fee It Would Still Be zero down transaction in the mind
buyer and the process would go on the first time I saw the house I pay back the $2000 so technically
you have no money in the transaction my return on investment is infinity is an example of no money making a lot of
in the second transaction When We sold I would have 2000 Dollars In My Pocket and we extended the loan to 30 years what
if I got paid money to make money I do not know but it should be saving $100 a month which actually started is
$50 because it after tax income for 40 years earn in low interest and again your text on the interest that is not to intelligent
may be safe but it's not smart a few years later is the Phoenix real estate market strength those houses will be sold for 60000
$10000 for closure opportunities were still available for became rare it cost of
my time to go out looking for them thousands of buyers were looking for the few available deals the market had changed
time to move on and look for other opportunities to put in the Asset column you cannot do that here that is against the law
comments much more often than can you show me how to do that the math is simple you do not need
legal transaction and the services of the payments I have no rules to fix or toilet to UN
because the owners do that it's their house occasionally someone does not pay and that is wonderful because there are late fees or
about in the properties sold again the court system handle that and it may not work in your area the market conditions may be different
Pati example illustrates how is simple financial process concrete hundreds of thousands of dollars with little money and low risk
an example of money being only in agreement anyone with the high school education can do it most people want
people listen to the standard advice of work hard and save money for about 3 hours of work approximately 190
and no taxes prepaid which one sounds harder to you
card pay 50% and Taxes save what is left your savings then and 5% which is also text over
to take the time to develop your financial intelligence harness the power of your brain and the Asset column if
how much time it takes to save 190 thousand Dollars time is one of your greatest
now you may understand why I silently shake my head when I hear parents say my child is doing well in school and receiving
it may be good but is it adequate I know the above investment strategy is a small one it is used to
how small can grow into big again my success reflects the importance of a strong financial Foundation which starts with the

I need to call my account to be prepared for cash and seek ways to shelter it the point I would like to make is that investment come and go
the market goes up and comes down economies improved and crash the world is always hand in Your opportunities of a lifetime
every day of your life but all too often we fail to see them but they are there and the more the world changes and the more Technology

it was a cute little two bedroom home with ginger bread terminal of the windows it was light blue with grey actions and had been built in 1930
inside there was a beautiful Rock fireplace as well as two tiny bedrooms it was a perfect rental house I gave the only 5000

take time to develop my overall philosophy is to plant seeds inside my asset column that is my formula I start small
in plant seeds some grow some doubt inside our real estate Corporation we have property with several million dollars
it is around right or real estate investment trust the point I am making is that most of those millions started out as little $5000
all of those down payments were fortunate to catch a fast rising market and increase tax free we traded in and out
surrounded by a corporation that can I call our personal Mutual Fund
we have friends who deals specifically with investors like us who have extra money each month to invest we buy high risk speculative private

if you are just throwing money into the deal and pray the idea in anything is to use your technical knowledge wisdom and
to lower the risk of course there is always risk it is financial intelligence that improves
what is risky for one person is less risky to someone else that is the primary reason I can't tell you encourage people to

last word on real estate I have travelled
in every city I hear people say you cannot buy real estate cheap that is not my experience
even in New York or Tokyo or just on the outskirts of the city Prime Bargains are overlooked by most people in Singapore with
my real estate prices there are still Bargains to be found within a short driving distance so whenever I hear someone say You can't do that here
I remind them that may be the real statement is I don't know how to do that here yet great opportunities or not
with your mind most people never get well be simply because they are not trained financial to recognise our opportunities
white in front of them I am often asked how do I start in the final chapter of this audiobook I offer 10 steps should I

most people never win because they are more afraid of losing that is why I found school so silly in school we
mistakes are bad and we are punished for making them yet if you look at the way humans are designed to learn we learn by making mistakes we

there are two kinds of investors one the first and most common
such as a real estate company a stock broker or financial planner and they buy
it could be a mutual fund alright a stock or bond it is a clean and simple way of investing in an energy
would be a shop for girls to a computer store and buy the computer right after shelf to the second type is an investor who creates investment
this investor usually assemble the deal on the same way a person who buys components builds a computer I do not know the first thing about putting
but I do know how to put pieces of opportunities together or no people who know how it is this second type
who is the more professional Ambassador sometimes it may take years for all the pieces to come together and sometimes they ne
erase the second type of investor that my Rich Dad encourage me to be it is important to learn how to put the pieces together
if you want to be the second
you need to develop three main skills these skills are in addition to those required to become financially intelligent
one find an opportunity that everyone else missed you see with your mind what others miss with their eyes for example
it was Spooky look at everyone wanted by he bought it what he saw that we did not
the house came with four extra empty lots he discovered that after going to the title company after buying the house he told the House Down
and solve the five lines to a builder for three times what you paid for the entire package he made 75000 for 2 months
it's not a lot of money but it sure beats minimum wage and it's not technically difficult to ra
the average person only goes to the bank this second type of investor needs to know how to raise capital and there are many ways
the don't require a bank to get started I learn how to buy houses without a bank it was to learn skill of raising money more
how is themselves that was priceless people say the bank won't let me money or I don't have the money to
if you want to be a type to investor you need to learn how to do that which stops most people in other words a majority of people
lack of money stop them for making a deal if you can avoid that obstacle you will be millions ahead of those who don't learn the skills
it has been many times I have bought a house a stack or an apartment building without a penny in the bank I want spot an apartment house for
20 million dollars I did what is called time it up with a written contract between seller and buyer and then
$100000 deposit which party 90 days to raise the rest of the money why did I do it simply because I knew it was
2 million dollars I never raised the money instead the person who put up the 100 thousand Dollars gave me 50000 for finding
to cover my position and I walked away total working time three days again it's what you know more than what you buy
investing is not buying it's more a case of knowing three organised smart people Intel

what to learn don't work for money job security met everything to my educated dad learning me
send to my Rich Dad a few years ago a granted in interview with a newspaper in Singapore the young female reporter was on time and
review get underway immediately we SAT in the lobby of luxurious Hotel shipping coffee and discussing the purpose of my visit to Singapore

but nothing happens so I keep my job with the paper
do you have any suggestions yes I do I said brightly a friend of mine here in Singapore runs a school the train
he runs sales training courses for many of the top corporations in Singapore and I think attending one of his courses would greatly and has your
are you saying I should go to school to learn to sell I know that you are serious are you
what is wrong with that I was now back pattern she was offended by something and now I was wishing I had not said anything
in my attempt to be helpful I found myself Defend in my suggestion I have a master's degree in English literature why would I go to school
learn to be a sales person I am a professional I went to school to be trained in a profession so I would not have to be a sales person I
all they want is money so tell me why I should study says she was back in her briefcase the interview
bus over on the coffee table set a copy of an earlier best selling book I wrote I picked it up as well as the notes
do you see this I said pointing to her notes she looked down at her notes what she said confused
she had written Robert Kiyosaki best selling Author
best selling Author not best writing author I said quietly her eyes widened I Am A terrible Rider I said
you are a great Rider I want to sell School you have a master's degree put them together and you get a best selling Author
anger flared from her eyes I'll never stop so lowest to learn how to sell people like you have no business
and you are a salesman it is not fair she found she put the rest of your notes away and
at least she gave me a fair and favourable write up the next morning the world is
talented educated and gifted people we meet them everyday they are all around us a few days ago
and the Young mechanic headed fixed in just a few minutes he knew what was wrong by simply listening to
I was amazed I am constantly shocked and how little talented people earn I have made brilliant highly educated
a business consultant who specialises in the medical trade was telling me how many doctors dentist
all this time I thought the one the graduated the dollars would Korean it was this business
who gave me the phrase they are one still away from great wealth what is phrase means is the most people need only to
and their income would jump exponentially I have mentioned before that financial intelligence is a Synergy of account
investing marketing and law combined those for technical skills and making money with money is easier than most people would be live
when it comes to money the only skill most people know is to work hard the classic example of a Synergy of skills was the young writer for the
if she doesn't even learn the skills of sales and marketing her income would jump traumatically if I were her I would take some course
advertising copywriting as well as sales then instead of working at the newspaper I would seek a job at an advertising agency even if
she would learn how to communicate in shortcuts that are used in successful advertising she also would spend time learning public relations
porn skill she would learn how to get millions in free publicity then at night and on weekends she could be right in her great novel

many people thought I was a fruit cake but the book sold and sold when I graduated from the US merchant marine
1969 my educated dad was happy standard oil of California had hired me for its oil tanker fleet as a third
the pay was low compared with my classmates but it was ok for first real job after college my studying pay was about 42
including over time and I only had to work for 7 months I had 5 months of vacation if I had wanted to
could have taken the round of Vietnam with a subset of shipping company and easily double my pay instead of taking 5 months of vacation I had
6 months with the company and join the Marine Court to learn how to fly my educated dad was devastated
Rich Dad congratulated me in school and in the workplace the popular opinion is the idea of specialisation that is
in order to make more money or get promoted you need specialised that is why medical doctors immediately began to seek a speciality such as orthopedics
pediatrics the same is true for accounts Architects lawyers Pilots and others my educated dad believed
same dogma that is why he was thrilled when he eventually achieved his doctorate he often made people who study more and more
about Lata Mangeshkar do exactly the opposite you want to know a little about a lot was
that is why for years I worked in different areas of his companies for a while I worked in his accounting department
I would probably never have done an account you wanted me to learn via Osmosis Rich Dad new I would pick up jargon and a sense of what
font and what is not I also worked as a bus boy and construction worker as well as in sales reservations and marketing
that is why he insisted we sitting on the meetings with his bankers lawyers Accountants and brokers he wanted us to know a little about
every aspect of his Empire when I quit my high paying job with standard oil my educated dad had a heart to heart talk with me he was bew
you cannot understand my decision to resign from a career that offered high pay great benefits lots of time of and opportunity for prom
when he asked me one evening why did you quit I could not explain it to him though I tried hard to my logic did not
problem was that my logic was my rich dad's logic job security and everything to my educ
learning met everything to my Rich Dad educated that thought I want to school to learn to be a ships officer
news that I want to school to study international trade so as a student I made cargo runs navigating large traders oil tankers and
steps to the forest and the South Pacific Rich Dad emphasized that I should stay in the Pacific instead of taking ships to Europe because he knew
why most of my classmates including mike for partying at the fraternity houses
I was studying trade people business styles and cultures in Japan Taiwan Thailand Singapore Hong Kong
samosa and the Philippines I was party in also but it was not in any flat house
educated dad just could not understand why I decided to quit and join the Marine core I told him I wanted
I want to fly but really I wanted to learn to lead troops which state explain to me that the hardest part of running in the company is Managing people
he has been three years in the army my educated dad was drafted except which date value learning to lead man into dangerous situations
leadership is what you need to learn next he said if you are not a good leader you get shut down the back just like they do in business
returning from Vietnam in 1973 a resized mathematician even though I loved flying I found a job with the xerox Corporation
I joined it for one reason and it was not for the benefits I was a shy person in the thought of selling was the most frightening subject in the
xerox has one of the best sales training programs in America Rich Dad was proud of me my educated dad
being an intellectual he thought that sales people would be low him I work with xerox for 4 years and till I overcome my fear of

if I failed I would go broke Rich Dad thought it best to go broke before 30 you still have time to recover was his advice
on the eve of my 30th birthday my first shipment left Korea for New York today I still do business internationally
my Rich Dad encourage me to do I keep seeking the emerging Nations today my investment company invest in South American countries and Asian countries
as well as in Norway and Russia there is an old cliche because job is an acronym for just over broke
fortunately I would say that applies to millions of people because School does not think financial intelligence is intelligence most workers
there is another horrible Management Theory the course workers work hard enough to not be fire
and owners pay just enough so that workers work and if you look at the pay scale of most companies again I would say there is a degree of
the net result is the most workers never get ahead they do what they have been taught to do get a
focus on working for pay and benefits that reward them in the short term but are often disasters in the long
instead I recommend to young people to seek work for what they will learn more than what they will earn look down the road at what
I want to acquire before choosing a specific profession and before getting trapped in the rat race most people are trapped in the life
