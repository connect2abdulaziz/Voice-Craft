many emotions named fear and greed first the fear of being without money motivate us to work hard and then once we get their pay check
greed or Desire start just thinking about all the wonderful things money can buy the pattern is then what pattern I asked
the pattern of get up go to work tables get up go to work tables people's lives are forever controlled by two emotions
fear and greed after them more money and they continue the cycle by increasing the spending this is what I call the rat race
there is another way might ask yes slowly but only a few people find it and what is that way
that's what I hope you boys will learn as you work and study with me that is why I took away all forms of paying
any hints my cast we are kind of tired of working hard especially for nothing while the first step is telling the truth that
we haven't been line I said I did not say you are lying I said to tell the truth Rich Dad retarded the truth about what
how you feeling Rich Dad said you don't have to say to anyone else just admitted to yourself you mean the people
the people who work for you Mrs Martin they don't do that I asked I doubt it said Rich Dad instead they feel
I'm not having money they don't confronted logically they react emotionally instead of using their heads Rich Dad said then the
cubox in your hands and again the emotions of joy Desire and greed takeover and again they react instead of think
their emotions control their brain like said that's correct made in the truth about how they feel they react to their
they feel the fear of they go to work help the fear but it doesn't it continues the hometown
open again that money will come their fears and again it doesn't feel keeps them in the trap of working
open the fear will go away but every day they get up and that all fear wake up
for millions of people that all fear keeps them awake all night cause in a night of turmoil and worry so they get up and
money is running their lives and they refused to tell the truth
money is in control of their emotions and their source rich dad's a quietly letting his words sentence
he said but didn't understand fully what he was talking about I just knew that I often wonder why grown up
it did not seem like much fun and they never looked that happy but something kept them going realising we had observed
Rich Dad said I want you boys to avoid that trap that is really what I want to teach you
not just to be rich because being rich does not solve the problem it doesn't I asked surprised no it doesn't
let me explain the other emotion Desire some college greed but I prefer Desire it's perfectly
more fun or exciting so people also work for money because of Desire they desi
money for the joy they think you can buy but the joy that money brings is often short lived and this so need more money for more joy
more comfort and more security so we keep working thinking money was through their souls that are troubled by fear and Desire but
do that even rich people do this might ask rich people included sir Rich Dad in fact the reason
rich people are rich isn't because of Desire but because of fear they believe that money can eliminate the fear of being poor so there
only to find the fear that was now they feel losing the money I have friends to keep working even though they have plenty
I know people who have millions who are more them to get rich
part of their soul is actually screaming louder they don't want to lose the big houses the cars and the
life money has bought them they worry about what difference would say if they lost all their money many are emotionally desperate and neurotic
and have more money so is a poor man happier I asked no I don't think so replied Rich Dad
has been attached to money as if I give the town direct one pastor table
by the large rubbish can and Ramesh in around in it the three hours watch time with great interest when before we probably would have just ignore him
Rich Dad Poor Dad in this world and just to the older man see in the money that direct came over immediately took the bill
which is good fortune is not much different from most of my employees said Rich Dad
I met so many people who say I am not interested in money at the work at a job for 8 hours a day that's the night of truth
if they want interested in money then why are they working that kind of thinking is probably more psychotic than a person who holds money
as I started listening to my Rich Dad my mind flat back to the countless times my own dad said I am not interested in money he said
he also covered himself by always saying I work because I love my job so what do we do I asked
not work for money and tell all traces of fear in Greater gone now that would be a waste of time so Rich Dad emotions are what
human the word emotion stands for energy in motion be truthful about your emotions and use your mind and emotions
your favourite Mike don't worry about what I just said it will make more sense
just be an observer not a reactor to your emotions most people do not know that it's their emotions that are doing
your emotions are your emotions but you've got to learn to do your own thinking can you give me an example
sure reply with that I need to find a job it's most likely any motion do in the thinking
fear of not having money generates that thought but people do need money if they have bills to pay I said sure they do smile
all I'm saying is that it's fear that is all too often do in the thinking I don't understand set mic
if the fear of not having enough money arises instead of immediately running out to get a job they instead might ask them
this question be the best solution to this field with the long run in my opinion the answer is no a job
really a short term solution to a long term problem but my dad is always saying stay in school and get good grades so you can find the
yes I understand he says that Rich Dad smiling most people recommend that and
it's a good path for most people but people make their recommendation primarily out of fear you mean my dad says that because he is afraid
yes sir Rich Dad he is terrified that you won't earn enough money and won't fit into society don't get me wrong he
and once the best for you I do believe in education in a job are important but it won't handle the fear you see that same
makes him get up in the morning to earn a few bucks is the fear that is causing him to be so fanatical about you are going to school so what do you recom
I asked I want to teach you the master the power of money instead of being afraid of it they don't teach that in school and if you don't
UBI commerce slave to money it was finally making sense he wanted us to wide nervous and to see what the Mrs modern
he used examples for the time but I have never forget them my vision wide that day
begin to see the trap the layer head for most people you see we are all employees ultimately we just work at different levels
I just want you boys to have a chance to avoid the Trap caused by those two emotions fear and Desire
them in your favour not against you that's what I want to teach you I am not interested in just teaching you to make a pile of money that won't
fear or Desire if you don't first handle fear and Desire and you get rich you are only be a highly paid slave
how do we avoid the Trap I asked the main cause of poverty or financial struggle is fear and ignorance not the economy or the
all the rich itself inflated fear and ignorance that keep people trapped so you boys go to school and get your college degrees
I don't teach you how to stay out of the trap the pieces of the puzzle word appearing my highly educated that had a great education
but School never told him how to handle money or his favourite it became clear that I could learn different and important things from
two fathers so you've been talking about the fear of not having money how does the desire for money affect or thinking my cast
how did you feel when I tempered you with a Paresh did you notice your desires rising we not at our heads by not giving into your emotions
you are able to delay your reactions and think that is important we will always have emotions of fear and greed from here onion
and for the long term to not let your emotions control your thinking most people used
and greed against themselves that's the start of ignorance most people live their lives chasing pages and
theory because of the emotions of Desire and fear not really questioning where those emotion driven thoughts are leading them it's just like the picture
just in front of it knows the dog is owner may be going where he wants to but the donkey is
sing an illusion tomorrow there were only be another carrot for the donkey you mean the moment I picture a new Facebook love candy
yes and as you get older your toys get more expensive a new car
and a big house to impress your friends said Rich Dad with a smile fear pushes you have the door and Desire call to you that's the
so what's the answer my cast what intensifies fear and Desire is ignorance that is why rich people
they get money is the correct the illusion if the donkey could see the whole picture it might
which that one on to explain the humans life is a struggle between ignorance and illumination
ignorance certain that struggle is a moment to moment decision
to learn to open or close one's mind look school is very important you go to school to learn skill or profession
to become a contributing member of society agriculture need teachers doctors mechanics artist cooks business people
firefighters and soldiers School Training on fortunately
for many people school is the end not the beginning there was a long silence which there was smiling I didn't
and everything he said that day but as with most great teachers his words continue to teach for years I've been a little cruel
but I want you to always remember this talk I want you to always think of MRS Martin and I want you always to remember that
never forget that fear and Desire can lead you into lives biggest trap if you are not aware of them controlling your thinking to spend
living in fear never exploring your dreams is cruel to work hard for money thinking that it will buy you things that will make you happy
to wake up in the middle of the night terrified about paying bills is a horrible way to live to live a life dictated by the
is not really live in a life thinking that a job makes you secure is lying to yourself that's cruel and
the Trap I want you to avoid I have seen how many runs people's lives don't let that happen to you please don't let money Run your
a softball road under article Rich Dad packed up and throw it back so what does ignorance have to do with
because it is ignorance about money because it's so much greater let me give you some examples
a doctor wanting more money to better provide for his family raises his fees by raising his face it makes Healthcare more expensive
what's the poor people the most so they have worst health than those with money because the doctor's raise their fees the arteries
school teachers want to race which race is our taxes and on and on and on
there will be such a horrifying gap between the rich and the poor the case will break out and another great Civilization will collapse
reproduce the great civilizations collapse when the gap between the house and have nuts is too great sadly America is on
because we haven't learnt from history we only memorize historical dates and names not the lesson
I asked in an educated society with a well Run government prices should actually come down of course that is
prices go up because of greed and fear caused by ignorance if school start people above money there will be
and lower prices but schools focus only on teaching people to work for money not how the harness money is power but don't we
business schools my cast and haven't you encourage me to go for my MBA yes sir Rich Dad but also often business schools train
who is to become sophisticated be Encounters heaven for better being counter takes over a business all they do is look at the numbers fire people
I know this because I have been counters always think about is cutting costs and raising prices which cause more problems
I wish more people knew it but it too is not the whole picture added Rich Dad angry so
yes sir Rich Dad learn to use your emotions to think not think with your emotions
I knew there was hope when you again registered your emotions when I attempted you with more money
emotionally charged that's the first step why is that step so important I asked
wow that's up to you to find out if you want to learn how to take your voice into the brighter patch a place almost everyone else avoids
if you go with me your let go of the idea of working for money and instead learn to have money work for you
we get if we go with you what if we agree to learn from you what will we get I asked the same thing where rabbit God said r
I asked yes sir Rich Dad the prior patch is our fear and
weaknesses and neediness by choosing our own thoughts is the way out choosing our thoughts
best puzzled yes choosing what we think rather than reacting to our emotions instead of just getting up and going to work because
having the money to pay your bills is caring you ask yourself is working harder at this the best solution to this problem most people
one of the door to a job they hate the tower baby is in control that's what I mean
using your thoughts and how do we do that my cast that's what I will teach you how teach you to have a choice of thought rather than I need
reaction like Gobind down your morning coffee and running out the door remember what I said before a job is only a short term
to a long term problem most people have only one problem in mind and its short term it's the bills at the end of the month the
Moneycontrol their lives or should I say the fear and ignorance about Moneycontrol set so they do as their parents did
get up everyday and go work for money not taking the time to ask the question is there another way there emotions now control
not their heads can you tell the difference between emotions thinking and the head thinking my cast oh yes I
all the time set Rich Dad I hear things like well everyone has to work over the richer Crooks or I'll get
I deserve this race you can't push me around or I like this job because it's secure no one asks is
something I missing here which would break through the emotional thought and give you time to think clearly as we headed back to the store
explain that the rich really did make money they did not work for he went on to explain that when I can I request in 5% pieces
where thinking we were making money we were very close to thinking the way the rich thing the problem was that creating money is legal for
banks to do but illegal for us to do there are legal ways to create money from nothing he told us Rich Dad want
illusion truly like the carrot for the donkey it's only out of fear and greed that the illusion of money
Together by billions of people who believe that money is real it's not money is really made up it is only because of the illusion
confidence and the ignorance of the message that this House of Cards stands he talked about the gold standard in America was on and that
no longer
add by something tangible if that happens boys all help lose the poor the middle class and the ignorant will have their
simply because they will continue to believe that money is real and that the company they work for over the government will look after them
really did not understand what he was saying that day but over the years it made more and more sense seen what others mess
as he climbed into his pickup truck outside his convenience store Rich Dad said keep working boys but the sooner you forget about need in a pay check
keep using your brain work for free and soon your mind will show you ways of making money for
you will see things that other people never see most people never see these opportunities because they're looking for money
so that's all they get the moment you see one opportunity you'll see them for the rest of your life the moment you do that
teach you something else learners and your avoid one of life's biggest traps Mike and I picked up our things from the store and the way it could buy
we went back to the park to the same picnic bench and spend several more hours thinking and talking we spend the next week at school
for two more weeks we kept thinking talking and working for free at the end of the second Saturday I was
and looking at the comic book stand with a longing days the hard thing about not even getting 30 second Saturday was that I did
any money to buy comic books suddenly as Mrs Martin said goodbye to Michael me I saw her do something I never seen her do before
Mrs Martin was cut in the front page of the comic book and have she kept the top half of the comic book cover and through the rest of the book into
cardboard box when I asked her what she did with the comic books she said I throw them away I give the top half of the cover back to the com
distribution of a credit when he brings in the new comics his come in an hour I can I waited for an hour soon the distributor
can I asked him if we can have the comic books to my delight he said you can have them if you work for the store and do not resolve them
remember are all business partnership will Mike and I revived it using a spare room In My Experiment we begin file in hundred
soon are comic book library was opened to the public younger sister who loves to study to be had
she charged each child 10 cm to the library which was open from 2:30 p.m. to 4:30 p.m. everyday after school
the customers the children of the neighbourhood could read as many comics as they wanted in 2 hours it was a bargain for the emission
my sister would check the kids as they left to make sure they want borrow in an economic books
you are so kept the books login in how many kids show the beach day who they were and any comments they might have written 9
read the comics for free which she rarely did
by working in the store every Saturday and collecting all the comic books from the different stores
any comic books we burn them once they got two tired we try to open in a branch office but
never quite find someone is trustworthy and dedicate as my sister had an early age we found out how hard it was to find goods staff
3 months after the library first open a fight broke out in the room some police from another neighbourhood post their way and mic stands
shut down the business so are comic book Business shut down and we start working on Saturdays at the convenience store but which there was excited
because he had new things he wanted to teachers he was happy because we had learnt our first lesson so well we learnt to make money work for
why not getting paid for our work at the store we were forced to use our imaginations to identify an opportunity to make money
we were in control of our own finances not dependent on employer the best part was
business generated money for us even when we want physically there are many worked for us instead of penis money
Rich Dad had given us so much more chapter 2 Lesson 2
financial literacy it's not how much money you make it's how much money you keep in 199
mitochondria his father's empire and is in fact doing a better job than his dad did we see each other once or twice a year on the Golf Course
Rich Dad Empire is in great hands and mike is now grooming his son to take his place as his dad
in 1994 I retired at the age of 47 and my wife came was 37 retirement does
changes we can work or not work and our wealth grows
staying ahead of inflation or assets are large enough to grow by themselves it's like planting a tree you water
and then one day it doesn't need you anymore it's roots are implanted deep enough then the tree provide shade for your enjoyment
Mike choose to run the empire and I chose to retire whenever I speak to groups of people they often ask what I would recommend that
how do I get started is there a book you would recommend what should I do to prepare my children what is your secret to success
I make millions whenever I hear one of these questions I am reminded of the following story the richest businessman
in 1923 a group of our greatest leaders and richest Businessman held a meeting at the edge over beach hotel in Chicago
head of the largest independent Steel company Samuel insult president of the world largest utility
how would have some head of the largest gas company President of International match company one of the world's largest companies
at the time lean freezer president of the bank of international settlements which president of the New York stock exchange
two of the biggest stock speculators and Albert fall a member of president Harris cabinet
25 years later 9 of these Titans and their lives as follows swap died panels every living for 5 years and borrowed
insult died broke in a foreign land and Cruiser in cotton also die broke option went inside with me and Albert fall
I doubt if anyone can say what really happened to this
if you look at the date 1923 it was just before the 1929 market crash and the Great Depression which I suspect had a great
the point is this today we live in times of Greater and faster change then these mended
fact there will be many booms and busts in the coming years there were only ups and downs these men face I am concerned the too many people
how to focus on money and not on the greatest wealth their education if people are prepared to be flexible keep an open mind and learn
problems they will have a rough ride intelligence
problems and produces money money without financial intelligence his money soon gone most people fail to realise that
it's not how much money you make it how much money you keep with all heard stories of lottery winners who are poor then suddenly rich
stories of professional athletes with the age of 24
sleeping under a bridge 10 years later I remember a story of a young basketball player who are you ago had
today at just 29 he claims his friends attorney and accountant took his money and he was forced to work at a car wash for minimum
he was fired from the car wash because he refused to take off his Championship ring is used wiping of the cars history made national
and discrimination he claims that the ring is all he has left and if it was stripped
I know so many people who became instant millionaires and while I am glad some people have become richer and richer I caution
set an alarm it's not how much money you make it's how much you keep and how many generations you keep it so when people ask
where do I get started or tell me how to get rich quick the often are greatly disappointed with my answer I simply say to them what my rich dad said
if you want to be rich you need to be financially literate that Idea was drummed in my head every time
as I said my educated that stressed the importance of reading books while my rich dad's trust the need to master financial Lite
if you are going to build the Empire State building the first thing you need to do is take a deep hole and power strong Foundation if
all you need to do is for 6 inch slab of concrete most people in their derived to get rich
build an Empire State building on a 6 inch slab our school system created in the aquarium age still believes in homes with
so kids graduate from school with Virtually no financial Foundation one day
live in the American dream they decide that the answer to their financial problems is to find a way to
quick construction on the skyscraper begins it goes up quickly and soon instead of the Empire State Building we have the le
12 years both of our choices were possible
strong financial Foundation when we were just kids accounting is possibly the most confusing boring
in the world but if you want to be rich long term it could be the most important subject for which that the question was
how to take a boring and confusing subject and teacher to kids the answer he found was to make it simple by teaching it in pictures
by Rich Dad Poor strong financial foundation for making me since we were just kid he created a simple way to teachers for years
Michael I understood the simple drawings the Dragon the movement of money and then in later years Rich Dad
adding numbers today Mike has gone on to master much more Complex and sophisticated accounting analysis because he had to in order to
Amazon fire I am not a sophisticated because my Empire is smaller but we come from the same simple Foundation over the following pages
we will discuss the same simple line drawing mic stand created for us the basic those drawings how to get two little boys in building
write sums of wealth on a solid and deep Foundation roll number one you must know the difference between an asset and
assets if you want to be rich this is all you need to know it is roll number 1 it is the only
please make sound absolutely simple but most people have no idea how profound this rule is most people struggle
because they do not know the difference between an asset and the liability rich people acquire assets the poor and Middle Class acquire
on which date explain this to make and me we thought he was kidding here we were
in this was his answer it was so simple that we stopped for a long time to think about it
what is an asset as Mike don't worry right now said Rich Dad just let the idea sinking if you can comprehend
it is simple that is why the idea is missed you mean
we need to know is what an asset is acquire them and will be rich I asked Rich Dad Northern he said it's that simple
Rich Dad smile because people do not know the difference between an acid and a liability
I remember asking how can I talk to be so misguided if it is that simple if it is that important why would everyone not want to find out
it took Rich Dad only a few minutes to explain what Assets and liabilities were as an adult I have difficulty explaining it to other adults
the simplicity of the idea escapes them because they have been educated differently they were taught by other educated professionals such as bankers
real estate agents financial planners and so forth the difficulty comes in asking adults to online or become children again
often feels it is the meaning to pay attention to simplistic definitions which they are believed in the case principal
keep it simple stupid or keep it super simple so he kept it simple for us and that made our financial Foundation strong
so what causes the confusion how could something so simple be so screwed up why would someone by an asset that was really a Li
the answer is found in basic education we focus on the word literacy and not financial literacy what
find something to be an asset or liability or not words in fact If you really want to be confused look up the word asset and liability
dictionary I know the definition may sound good to attend account but for the average person it makes no sense but we adults
towards young boys Rich Dad said what defines an asset or not words
and if you can read the numbers you can turn on acid from a hole in the ground in accounting Rich Dad would say it's not the number
but what the numbers are telling you it's just like words it's not the words but the story the words are telling you if you want to be rich
to read and understand numbers if I heard that once I heard it a thousand times for my Rich Dad and I also heard the rich acquire
acquire liabilities here is how to tell the difference between an asset and the liability most account
and financial professionals do not agree with the definitions but these simple drawings were the start of strong financial foundations for two young boys
an acid is something which money in my pocket a liability is something that takes money out of my packet this is really all you
if you want to be rich simply spend your life buying assets if you want to be poor or middle class spend your life buying
illiteracy both in words and numbers is the foundation of financial struggle if people are having difficulties financially
something that they don't understand either in words or numbers the rich are rich because they are more literate in different areas than people
so if you want to be rich and maintain your well it's important to be financially literate in words as well as numbers
numbers alone mean little justice contact mean little it's the story that counts in financial reporting reading number
the story of where the cash is flowing in 80% of most families the financial story pains a picture of hard work
get ahead however this effort is for not because they spend their lives buying liabilities instead of assets everyone has
the need for food shelter and clothing it is the cash flow of the tells the story of how a person handles their money
reason I started with the story of the richest man in America is to illustrate the floor and believe in the money will solve all problems that is why I
I mean that so I need to make more money
but more money will often not solve the problem in fact it may compound the problem money often makes always our tragic human flowers
food in a spotlight on what we don't know that is why I want to open a person who comes into a certain windfall of cash but say in inheritance
before money
accentuate the cash flow pattern running in your head if your parents to spend everything you get most likely in increasing cash will just result
a fool and his money is one big party I have said many times do we go to school to games
I am professional skills both of which are important we learn to make money with our professional skills in the 1960s when
High School if someone did well academically people assumed this bright student will go on to be a medical doctor because it was the profession with the promise of the
best financial report today doctor space financial challenges I would wish on my worst enemy in short companies taking control of the
manage Healthcare government intervention and malpractice suits today kids want to be famous athletes movie stars
beauty Queens or CEO because that is where the Fame money and prestigious that is the reason it is so hard to motivate
school today they know the professional success is no longer slowly linked to academic success as it once was
because students leave school without financial skills millions of educated people pursue their professions successfully but later find themselves
what is missing from their education is not how to make money but how to manage money
it's called financial aptitude what you do with the money once you make it how to keep people from taking it from you how to keep it longer
how to make that money work hard for you most people don't understand by the struggle financial because they don't understand cash flow a

come to one of my talks to hear what I have to say they ask me can you tell us how to make more money they don't understand that there trouble is really how

people still challenge me on the idea of a house not been an asset I know that for many people it is their dream as well as their largest investment
and owning your own home is better than nothing I simply offer an alternative way of looking at this particular dogma if my wife and I would
